            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a iuſt taxation of our times by graue and reuerend <hi>Beza, Dum tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſuperiora cum noſtris comparo, dicere conſueui plus illos conſcientiae ſcientiae minus habuiſſe; nos contrà ſcientiae plus, conſcientiae minus habere:</hi> The braines of men were neuer more ſtuffed, their tongues neuer more ſtirring, and yet their hearts neuer more emptie, their hands neuer more idle. The diſeaſe of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers was ignorance, ours is impiety; they were ill in the head, we are ſicke at the heart: they were blinde but (after their manner) deuout, wee are skilfull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane. No age was euer bleſſed with ſuch a light of knowledge, and yet none more fruitfull of the workes of darkneſſe. The maine reaſon vndoubtedly why wiſedome and holineſſe, learning and ſanctitie are ſo vſually now a daies diuorced, is becauſe (as that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of old could complaine) <hi>diſputare malumus quàm viuere:</hi> If men can argue and diſcourſe of religion it ſuffices, not one of a thouſand thoroughly digeſts his knowledge, or turnes the holy Precepts of Diuinitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to practiſe. Hence, the world abounds with <hi>Polemicall</hi> bookes, which doe not ſo much compoſe as breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; (though I confeſſe the fault is not ours, but our Aduerſaries, whoſe peruerſnes will not be conuicted euen when they are conuicted:) But for <hi>practicall</hi> diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and liuely deuotion, it is an argument not more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then rare, handled but by few and not by many regarded. Yet in this iniquity of times, wherein the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of men had more need to be ordered then their iudgements informed: in my opinion, thoſe Treatiſes
<pb facs="tcp:599:5"/> are of beſt ſeruice and vſe which reduce Chriſtianity into action, and warme the heart and conſcience with deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this ranke I account this <hi>Commentary:</hi> which was a principall motiue vnto mee (as we all owe our ſelues vnto the common good) not to ſmother a worke ſo ſeruiceable for this age, nor to bereaue Gods Church of ſuch a furtherance; eſpecially being herein encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by ſundry reuerend and iudicious.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Commentarie</hi> perhaps not to the taſte of many men in this age, whoſe nice palate doth loath the dry <hi>manna,</hi> and can beſt relliſh the vnſauory ſauces of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (who cannot fancie Diuinity vnleſſe ſhe be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly trim'd vp in the light colours of humane art and eloquence) will here require elegancie of words, and quarrell at his careleſſe ſtile. I anſwer, <hi>mores non verba compoſuit, &amp; animis dixit non auribus,</hi> the ſcope of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors was his auditors inſtruction not his own applauſe, nor did he care to pleaſe ſo much as to profit. To come with the <hi>inticing words of mans wiſedome,</hi> and to <hi>preach</hi> only <hi>themſelues</hi> is the note of falſe Teachers: the charge of Chriſts Miniſter is <hi>in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power to diuide the word of truth aright</hi> vnto his people, and this was our Authors aime. Gods oracles are to be faithfully expounded, not curiouſly minced, not looſly dallied with, &amp; ſurely the plaine ſong of <hi>Scripture</hi> is the beſt muſicke without theſe quauering deſcants of mans wit. How licentiouſly &amp; prophanely <hi>Popiſh Friers</hi> haue abuſed Gods holy word by their trifling <hi>Poſtills,</hi> it is too manifeſt. Yea (be it ſpoken with due modeſty and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe <hi>Worthies,</hi> to whoſe induſtry and wit the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> is ſo much beholding,) ſome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Doctors</hi> were too far in loue with quaint interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: eſpecially <hi>Origen,</hi> whoſe exceſſiue allegorizing

Which conſideration, no doubt, moued <hi>Caluin, Melanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon, Martyr,</hi> and the reſt of our late and learned Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to ſticke ſo cloſe to the letter of the Text, and in all ſimplicitie to deliuer the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt. Their iudgement our Author approued, and followed their example, opening in theſe <hi>Lectures</hi> the ſimple and moſt naturally intended ſenſe of the holy Apoſtle, and and thence vrging &amp; applying the Obſeruations ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, that many (not only of his ordinarie hearers, but euen of the <hi>Vniuerſitie,</hi> by whom he was much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) bleſſed God for the direction and comfort they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from his mouth. The life of deliuery in him was very powerfull, &amp; made great impreſſion in his hearers: this booke wants that adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, which yet is here ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe thoſe things which then were only deliuered in the eares of few, are here ſubmitted to the eyes of all.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Author</hi> himſelfe I need not ſay much. Altho (after a ſort) he condemned himſelfe to obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and affected a priuate and retired life: yet he could not hide himſelfe from the eyes of the world, being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally noted and eſteemed for his holines, his integrity, his learning and grauity, his indefatigable paines in the diſcharge of his miniſteriall function, his ſingular wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and dexteritie in the gouernment of our <hi>Colledge,</hi> which by Gods bleſſing vpon his care hath ſent forth many learned Miniſters into the Church, many worthy Gentlemen into the Common-wealth. Briefely, in his whole conuerſation he was ſo ſincere &amp; vnrebukeable, that by ſome (partly by occaſion of theſe <hi>Lectures</hi>) he was defamed for preciſenes. Indeede, as the times are

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN firſt it pleaſed the Lord to call me to this ſet worke in this place, by reaſon of my ſhort time to deliberate, I choſe for the time that text of ſcripture which was appointed to be read for the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle the next Sabbath, beginning at the 5 verſe of the 2 chapter of this Epiſtle, purpoſing afterward to make choiſe of ſome other ſcripture which happily might better fit this place.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:599:13"/> But ſo it pleaſed the Lord to diſpoſe that I ſhould goe forward euen throughout the Epiſtle vnto the end, and the laſt day conclude my obſeruations therevpon in your hearing. Now I haue thought good againe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with that whereof I haue made an end, that ſo, if the Lord will, the meaning of this whole Epiſtle, and the doctrines thereof, may in good time be deliuered in your hearing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul and Timotheus]</hi> I ſhall not neede to ſpeake much touching the occaſion wherevpon the Apoſtle wrote this Epiſtle, becauſe I haue already ſpoken almoſt of all the things that occaſioned it. The <hi>Philippians</hi> hauing heard of the Apoſtles impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> vnto him, with reliefe from them to ſupply his neceſſities. Wherevpon <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Rome,</hi> told the Apoſtle the ſtate of the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> how that there were falſe Apoſtles crept in amongſt them, which vrged circumciſion, and the works of the Law, and that the <hi>Philippians</hi> conſtantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them. The Apoſtle therefore to commend their conſtancy for their further incouragement therevnto, to arme them againſt the falſe teachers for their cleare ſatisfaction in the points which they vrged, and to giue them thanks for their great liberalitie towards him, wherein they ſhewed their care for him, wrote this Epiſtle vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Wherein, as in all other his Epiſtles is 1. ſet downe the inſcription. 2. the ſalutation. 3. the body of the Epiſtle it ſelfe. In the inſcription, 1. we haue the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſaluting. 2. the perſons ſaluted. The perſons ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting are deſcribed 1. by their proper names, and then by a title of dignitie commune to them both. The names of the perſons ſaluting are, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timotheus: Paul,</hi> called alſo ſometimes <hi>Saul,</hi> the writer of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and <hi>Timotheus</hi> the approuer of it; or <hi>Paul</hi> the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, and <hi>Timotheus</hi> the writer of it. The title of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie commune to them both whereby they are deſcribed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:599:13"/> is this, the ſeruants of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> ſeruants both, and therefore to attend vpon their miniſterie and ſeruice, and both ſeruants of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and therefore to attend vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on the miniſtration of the goſpell which he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them, but yet the ſeruants of <hi>Ieſus</hi> the Sauiour of the world, euen of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> annointed a King to defend vs, a Prophet to teach vs, and a Prieſt to offer vp a ſacrifice for our ſinnes. The perſons ſaluted are ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerally, the whole Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Biſhops, and Deacons there. The whole Church at <hi>Philippi</hi> generally is ſaluted vnder the name of all the Saints in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> which are at <hi>Philippi.</hi> for by all the ſaints in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> he meaneth all them which in baptiſme had giuen their names vnto <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> thenceforth to die vnto ſinne, and to liue vnto God in righteouſnes and true holineſſe, which was all the Church at <hi>Philippi.</hi> Now this <hi>Philppi</hi> was a chiefe Citie in the parts of <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>whoſe inhabitants came from Rome to dwell there,</hi> the firſt Citty in the paſſage out of <hi>Thracia</hi> beyond the riuer <hi>Strymon.</hi> At the firſt it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought to haue beene called <hi>Crenida,</hi> becauſe of the many fountaines about the hill whereon it was built, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> being as much as <hi>fons:</hi> and afterward to haue beene called <hi>Philippi,</hi> becauſe of the fortification and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement thereof by <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon;</hi> and now to be called <hi>Gricopolis,</hi> as if yee would call it <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopolis,</hi> a Citty of gold, becauſe of the great abundance of gold that is there, ſo great that <hi>Philip</hi> is ſaid to haue receiued thence yearely aboue 1000 talents of gold, which is aſmuch as 600 thouſand french crownes. This Citty is notably knowne, as for the great ouerthrow of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> there by <hi>Octauius</hi> and <hi>Antonie;</hi> ſo eſpecially for the preaching of the goſpell there by <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> for the embracing of the truth there by their miniſterie, and for many other accidents there during the Apoſtle his abode there: for <hi>Paul</hi> being warned by the ſpirit to goe into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> hee went
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:599:14"/> thither, and firſt came to <hi>Philippi,</hi> &amp; there preached, and by his preaching converted <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſo that ſhee and her houſhold were baptized. Afterwards he caſt out of a maide a ſpirit of diuination. Wherevpon hee was brought before the Magiſtrates, ſore beaten with rods, caſt into the inner priſon, and his feete thruſt into the ſtocks. Being there in priſon, the foundation of the priſon was ſhaken by an earth-quake, the dores were opened, the priſoners bands were looſed, the Iaylor was conuerted, he and his houſe baptized, and the Apoſtle deliuered. For theſe things this Citie is well knowne, and it was the Church generally in this Citie, that the Apoſtle ſaluted.</p>
                  <p>The perſons more particularly ſaluted are the Biſhops and Deacons there. Where by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> he meaneth the Paſtors and Teachers which laboured in the word and doctrine. For both the word ſo ſignifieth throughout the whole New Teſtament, and here it muſt needs ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, becauſe he ſpeaketh of many in one Church. By <hi>Deacons</hi> alſo, he meaneth thoſe that by their office were to receiue and diſtribute the common liberalitie of the Church, according to the neceſſities of all the poore members thereof, ſuch as we read to haue beene ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 6 5. and ſuch as are deſcribed by our Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Vnto whom together with the Biſhops, the Apoſtle is thought here to write, as to magnifie their office, ſo becauſe theirs had beene the care chiefly in reſpect of their office, to ſend the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches liberalitie to him by their Miniſter <hi>Epaphroditus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſalutation followeth, wherein he wiſheth them all good from him which is the author of all goodneſſe. Where 1. is ſet downe the thing which he wiſheth vnto them, which is <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> vnderſtanding by <hi>grace</hi> the free fauour of God, wherewith he loueth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and whence as from the fountaine all other good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth flow: and by <hi>peace</hi> euery bleſſing corporall and ſpirituall, for this life and that that is to come, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:599:14"/> from that fountaine of grace. 2. is ſet downe vnto whom he wiſheth this <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> namely vnto all the Saints at <hi>Philippi, together with the Biſhops &amp;c.</hi> 3. is ſet downe the author from whom, and by whom he wiſheth this <hi>grace and peace</hi> vnto them, which is from <hi>God our father</hi> as the fountaine and firſt originall, from whom commeth <hi>euery good and perfect gift,</hi> and from the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as the meanes by whom euery grace of the ſpirit is conveyed and deriued vnto vs. Thus much for the purpoſe of the Apoſtle in theſe words, and the meaning of them. Now let vs ſee what notes we may gather hence for our farther vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul and Timotheus]</hi> Firſt then for the very name of <hi>Paul</hi> it ſhould not paſſe vs reading, or hearing of it, but therein we ſhould obſerue the great mercy of our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God towards ſinfull creatures. For what was <hi>Paul</hi> that now wrote vnto the Churches here and there to ſtabliſh them in the faith? Surely he was ſometimes a bloudy <hi>Saul,</hi> a cruel perſecutor of Gods Church, one that hauing receiued authoritie of the High Prieſts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 26.10.</note> ſhut vp many of the Saints in priſon, and when they were put to death gaue his ſentence,<note place="margin">11.</note> &amp; puniſhed them throughout all the ſynagogues, and compelled them to blaſpheme, and being more madde vpon them perſecuted them euen vnto ſtrange Cities, one that was a blaſphemer,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note> an oppreſſor, that ſpared neither men nor women,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 22.4.</note> but beat them, and bound them, and deliuered them vnto death,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13.</note> one that perſecuted the Church of God extreamely, and waſted it. All which things himſelfe teſtifieth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Could there well haue beene a more forlorne man, a more deſperate and godles creature? Yet this man was receiued vnto mercy, yea vnto ſuch mercy, that the Lord called him to be an Apoſtle, and choſe him to beare his name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of Iſrael. And that this was a worke of the Lord his owne mercy, our Apoſtle himſelfe witneſſeth, where he thus ſaith, <hi>I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:599:15"/> and an oppreſſor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.13.</note> 
                     <hi>but I was receiued to mercy.</hi> And why was he receiued to mercy? himſelfe tells vs ſaying, <hi>for this cauſe was I receiued to mercy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">16.</note> 
                     <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould first ſhew on me all long-ſuffering, to the enſample of them that ſhall in time to come beleeue in him vnto eternall life.</hi> It was then the Lord his great mercy towards him, that of a cruell perſecutor he became an holy Apoſtle of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and this mercy was ſhewed on him, that in him might be an example of Gods mercy towards miſerable ſinners. I might inſtance in the like mercy of the Lord towards <hi>Matthew,</hi> firſt a Publican, afterwards an Euangeliſt; to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> firſt a ſinfull man, afterwards a notable conuert; towards the theefe on the Croſſe, ere while on the croſſe, after a while in paradiſe &amp;c. but I will not trouble you with multitude of examples, wherein might appeare the riches of Gods great mercies, towards great and grieuous ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Neither let this be any encouragement vnto any man, to let looſe the reynes vnto ſinne, becauſe <hi>where ſinne aboundeth there mercy aboundeth much more:</hi> for if any man vpon ſuch examples of his mercies ſhall preſume and make bold to ſinne, let him alſo know, that as the Lord is mercifull, ſo is he alſo iuſt, and that towards him and ſuch as he is, <hi>iuſtice ſhall triumph ouer mercy.</hi> Rather let this ſo louing mercy of the Lord teach vs, neither to deſpaire in our ſelues, nor of others, though great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for what though we haue omitted ſuch things a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And who knoweth of any but the Lord may giue grace vnto repentance, and then ſurely followeth mercy. The Lord his mercies are in his owne diſpenſing: he may when he will, and he doth when he ſeeth it good, renue the heart, and grant mercy. Though therefore the prodigall childe runne a lewde courſe for a long time, yet let vs hope that the Lord will at length giue grace vnto repentance, and receiue him vnto mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul and Timotheus]</hi> The ſecond thing which I note is, that the Apoſtle ioyneth vnto himſelfe <hi>Timothie,</hi> aged <hi>Paul,</hi> yong <hi>Timothie,</hi> an excellent Apoſtle, an inferior Miniſter; the author of the Epiſtle, him that onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued it, or at the moſt wrote it from his mouth; and all this to grace and credit <hi>Timothie</hi> with the <hi>Philippians,</hi> vnto whom he meant ſhortly to ſend him, as it appeareth by the next chapter, verſ. 19. Whence 1. I obſerue a notable example of rare humilitie. for a rare and ſeldom thing it is to be ſeene, ſuperiors to receiue their inferiors into the honor of their labors, and to be willing that what honor or fauour may accrew vnto them by their labors, may be communicated likewiſe to their inferiors, who had little or no hand in them. Nay commonly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors in authority, or learning, or otherwiſe, count it a great debaſing vnto themſelues, to be thought to haue had their inferiors to haue ioyned with them in their la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours, to haue vſed their helpe, or to equall them with themſelues. Yet ſuch was <hi>Pauls</hi> humilitie, that he glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued <hi>Timothie,</hi> a faithfull miniſter of the goſpell, but farre inferior vnto him, into the honor of his labors, and equalled him vnto himſelfe, as if his hand had been as farre in the writing of this Epiſtle as was his owne, that as they ſhould accept of him for it, ſo they might accept
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:599:16"/> of <hi>Timothie</hi> alſo. He had learned that leſſon well, which our bleſſed Sauiour gaue both him and vs to learne from himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29.</note> ſaying, <hi>Learne of me that I am meeke and lowly in heart.</hi> And himſelfe herein gaue the <hi>Philippians</hi> a good patterne of that, wherevnto afterward he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3.</note> that <hi>in meekneſſe of minde euery man ſhould eſteeme others better than himſelfe.</hi> His eſtimation of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> and his lowlineſſe of heart are ſufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by this his aſſociating of him vnto himſelfe: but ſuch a ſelfe-liking hath now poſſeſſed men that ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie is hardly to be found. Euery man likes his owne labors ſo well, and ſtands ſo much vpon his reputation, that he cannot endure the diſgrace, that any man ſhould ſay or thinke, that he hath had this or that helpe, this or that aduiſe, that he neuer did this or that of himſelfe. To haue the credit or commendation of any thing well done of our ſelues we like it well, but if any be ioyned in with vs, eſpecially our inferiors, we make little reckning, and oftentimes had as lieue want it as haue it ſo. So far are we from the Apoſtles humilitie. Wherevnto if we will attaine, we muſt not thinke of our ſelues <hi>aboue that is meete,</hi> wee muſt thinke of others according to their worth, we muſt not thinke much to receiue others into the honors of our labors, and we muſt make our ſelues <hi>equall to them of lower ſort</hi> then our ſelues. And this if we doe we ſhall be good followers of the Apoſtles hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this ioyning of <hi>Timothy</hi> vnto himſelfe, I obſerue a good patterne of that care which ought to be had of of the Miniſters credit with his people. For wherefore did the Apoſtle ioyne <hi>Timothy</hi> vnto himſelfe? He meant to ſend <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhortly vnto the <hi>Philippians to inſtruct them in the waies of God more perfectly,</hi> as appeareth by the next chapter: &amp; therfore for the better credit of him in his miniſtery with them when he ſhold come vnto them, in writing vnto them he receiueth him into the honor of his labors, &amp; ioyneth him vnto himſelf. So ſhould they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:599:16"/> doe that are called vnto greater place in the Church then others of their calling. They ſhould by all meanes ſeeke the grace, and credit, and countenance of the Miniſter with his people; yea whatſoeuer might be for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of him in his miniſtery they ſhould with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care regard it: for the grace we ſee of the Miniſter is the grace of his miniſtery; and the more he is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by his ſuperiors, the more he preuaileth in his miniſtery with his people. As therefore they would giue teſtimony of their care of the Church, and of the buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding vp thereof by the miniſtery of the goſpell, ſo they ſhould haue care of the Miniſters credit with his people. And I wiſh they would doe ſo. But I paſſe ouer to that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which here I note, is the title of dignity common to them both, whereby both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> are deſcribed. In the latter to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> and in the epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> the Apoſtle in the inſcription of his Epiſtles ioynes <hi>Timothy</hi> to himſelfe as here he doth, but there in title he ſeuereth himſelfe from <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Paul as Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt and our brother Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus:</hi> and likewiſe in the Epiſtle to <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hence then 1. I obſerue a duty for the Miniſters of the goſpell, whereof their very names is to put them in minde. They are called
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:599:17"/> the ſeruants of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> they muſt therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that they are ſo, and carry themſelues as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and not <hi>Lords ouer Gods heritage.</hi> A ſeruant is to doe that, and that onely which his maſter commands him, he is to be faithfull in his ſeruice, he is not to ſeeke his own, but the things of his maſter, his life is not to be deare vnto him in the ſeruice of his maſter. The Miniſters then of the goſpell, being the ſeruants of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as he doth bid them to plucke vp, or to root out, or to deſtroy, or to build, or to plant, ſo they are to doe. If he giue them a roule to eat, they muſt eat it vp; if he giue them a commiſſion, they muſt looke vnto it, and not goe without the bounds of it; if he ſend them to Kings and Princes, or whomſoeuer, they muſt keepe nothing backe, but deliuer vnto them <hi>all the counſell of God;</hi> if he require them to lay downe their liues for his ſake, they muſt not <hi>loue their liues vnto the death. Goe,</hi> (ſaith our bleſſed Sauiour) <hi>and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,</hi>

                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then vnto them that coyne vs out new articles of the faith, that adde, and detract, and change at their pleaſure the rites and ceremonies in the Sacraments, that thruſt vpon vs traditions, and vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten verities, that preſſe vs with a number of things, as obſeruation of daies, and moneths, &amp; times, and yeares, vowes of pouerty, chaſtitie, and blinde obedience, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> invocation of Saints, adoration of images, and the like, things neuer commanded by God, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:599:17"/> any warrant in the word? Are theſe the ſeruants of Chriſt Ieſus? They will needs be the Vicars and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents of Chriſt Ieſus vpon earth. But is not this to carry themſelues as Lords ouer Gods heritage, thus to rule ouer them in things not commanded by the Lord? If they be the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, they may not rule ouer the conſciences of men in things not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lord; or if they ſo rule ouer them, they are not the ſeruants of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, what ſhall we ſay vnto them that hide their talent in the earth, that ſuffer the graces of Gods ſpirit to wax idle and to decay in them, that doe not vſe the gifts beſtowed vpon them, to the gaining of men vnto the faith, and to the increaſe of Chriſt his kingdome; that ſowe pillowes vnder all arme-holes, that heale the hurt of the daughter of the Lords people with ſweet words, ſaying, <hi>peace, peace, when there is no peace,</hi> that giue not the people warning when they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that keepe backe part of their meſſage, and do not deliuer the whole counſell of God as they are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Are theſe the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt?<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.</note> Of euery ſeruant, and of euery diſpoſer it is required that <hi>he be faithfull.</hi> Now is this to be faithfull in the Lord his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, either to leaue it vndone, or to do it otherwiſe then it ſhould be done, or to doe it but in part, and by halues? If ſo, then let theſe be ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt; if not, then either they are no ſeruants, or vnfaithfull ſeruants of Chriſt Ieſus. And to be none, or to be but bad ones is no great difference.</p>
                  <p>Againe, what ſhall we ſay vnto them that with <hi>Demas</hi> forſake <hi>Paul, and embrace this preſent world,</hi> that with <hi>Diotrephes</hi> loue rather to haue the praeeminence amongſt men then to labor in the works of their calling, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their eaſe, or their pleaſure, or their profit, and looke not to the charges committed vnto them,<note place="margin">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:599:18"/> of Chriſt Ieſus? A good ſeruants care is about his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters matter, not his owne. So that if they be ſeruants, yet ſurely no good ſeruants, becauſe they care for their owne and not their maſters, or more then their maſters.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, what ſhall we ſay vnto them, that when perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and troubles ariſe, ſtart aſide like a broken bowe, that loue their liues better then that for their miniſtery, they will hazard them vnto the death, that either will not ſpeake vnto <hi>Herod,</hi> or elſe will handle the matter better then that for ought they will ſpeake, they will loſe their head with <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> or be caſt into priſon, and there haue their feete clapt faſt in the ſtocks with <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> the Prophet? Are theſe the ſeruants of Chriſt Ieſus? Our Apoſtle when he was going vnto certaine bands, <hi>I paſſe not at all</hi> ſaith he <hi>neither is my life deare vnto my ſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>ſo that I may fulfill my courſe with ioy, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration which I haue receiued of the Lord Ieſus, to teſtifie the goſpell of the grace of God.</hi> Here was a good ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſuch ſhould all his ſeruants be, and they that are not ſuch are either none, or no good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Ieſus Chriſt. If then we will be rightly entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> vnto the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, let his word be our warrant for whatſoeuer we teach men to obſerue and doe, and let vs not dare to paſſe the limits of our commiſſion to doe otherwiſe then we haue receiued commandment of our Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter Chriſt Ieſus: let vs faithfully vſe the gifts and graces of Gods ſpirit beſtowed vpon vs, for the gaining of men vnto the faith and knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, and let vs not dare either to ſmother them, or otherwiſe to lay them out then to our maſters aduantage, let vs alwaies in all th ngs ſeeke the honor and glory of Chriſt Ieſus, and let vs not dare to ſeeke out owne eaſe, or pleaſure, or profit, or honor more then the things of Chriſt Ieſus; let our miniſtration which we haue receiued of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Chriſt Ieſus, be moſt precious in our eyes, and let not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:599:18"/> our liues be deare vnto vs to ſpend them in his ſeruice. Thus indeed ſhall we be rightly entituled vnto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt Ieſus in reſpect of our miniſtery; and thus ſhall we well diſcharge that duty, whereof this title may ſufficiently remember vs.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I obſerue from this title wherevnto <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> are entituled, is the great honor and dignitie vouchſafed vnto the miniſters of the goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. For what greater honor and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity then this to be <hi>the ſeruants of Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> the Saui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>our of the world, the mighty God, the King of glory, the prince of peace, the great biſhop of our ſoules, the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting high prieſt of our profeſſion, and that in that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to beare his name before the Kings, and Princes, and great men of the earth, to be his Ambaſſadors to declare his will vnto his people, to be his ſtewards to giue euery man their portion of meat in due ſeaſon? <hi>Let a man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo thinke of vs as of the Miniſters of Chriſt. and diſpoſers of the ſecrets of God.</hi> And how can a man be better eſteemed then if he be ſo thought of? Againe, <hi>we,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>are ambaſſadors for Chriſt.</hi> What, for Chriſt? what honor is this?<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note> To be Ambaſſadors for a mortall Prince is ſuch an honor, as not many great men are vouchſafed vnto. What honor then is it to bee ambaſſadors for Chriſt the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, which all the miniſters of the goſpell are? And when the Lord told <hi>Ananias,</hi> that <hi>Paul was a choſen veſſell vnto him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15.</note> 
                     <hi>to beare his name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and children of Iſrael,</hi> in effect he told him, that he had called him vnto the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor among the ſonnes of men. And yet this is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all them that ſerue him in the miniſterie of the goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Which honor if he knew that will needs be the vicar of Chriſt on earth, then why doth he not reſt ſatisfied with this honor, to be <hi>the ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in the miniſtery of the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, but he muſt be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:599:19"/> the ſupreme head ouer all perſons vpon earth, ſo that Kings and Princes muſt lay downe their Crownes at his feete, and be depoſed and diſpoſed of at his pleaſure? Howſoeuer he know it, or know it not, if it be knowne amongſt vs, why is it that we are made as the filth of the world, and the off-ſcowring of all things? The calling of a Miniſter what more baſe and contemptible amongſt men? and yet what calling indeed more high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable? Whoſe perſon more maligned and diſgraced, then the perſon of the Miniſter? and yet whoſe more to be reuerenced and countenanced? Well, howſoeuer commonly we be thought of, we are the ſeruants of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in the miniſtery of the goſpell for your ſakes, and <hi>as though God did beſeech you through vs, we pray you in Chriſts ſteed that yee be reconciled vnto God.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer yee thinke of vs, yet thinke as yee ought of the word of your ſaluation which we bring vnto you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it from vs not <hi>as the word of man, but as it is indeede the word of God, which is able to make you wiſe vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth thing which I note is in the perſons of them whom he ſaluteth, and vnto whom he writeth. The perſons generally are <hi>all the ſaints in Chriſt Ieſus which are at Philippi,</hi> euen the whole Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> ſo many as were baptized into Chriſt Ieſus. Whence I obſerue, what ought to be the ſtudie euen of the whole Church militant, which is, to be <hi>ſaints in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> that ſuch as they are in outward profeſſion, ſuch they may bee in truth and in deed through the power of the of the ſpirit of ſanctification in <hi>the inner man.</hi> Now we are, ſo many as are baptized into the name of Chriſt Ieſus, by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion <hi>ſaints and holy,</hi> our baptiſme ſo witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our holy profeſſion, as circumciſion did the Iewes. It is then another holineſſe wherevnto we are to <hi>giue all diligence,</hi> then this ſacramentall holineſſe, euen an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent holineſſe, that being <hi>ſanctified throughout both in our ſoules and in our bodies, we may be blameleſſe vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:599:19"/> of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> We muſt ſtudie to be <hi>holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> euen <hi>as he which hath called vs is holy, denying vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and liuing ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> And here vnto we doe binde our ſelues as it were by ſolemne vow and obligation in the preſence of the Church, when we are ſacramentally ſanctified by baptiſme, promiſing there to <hi>forſake the deuill and all his workes, conſtantly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Gods holy word, and obediently to keepe his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> So that <hi>thenceforth,</hi> as the Apoſtle often exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>we ſhould walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,</hi> we ſhould <hi>crucifie the fleſh with the affections and the luſts and walke in the ſpirit in newneſſe of life;</hi> we ſhould <hi>caſt off the old man which is corrupt through the deceiuable luſts, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſnes and true holineſſe:</hi> in a word, we ſhould <hi>die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto God.</hi> Otherwiſe how is our baptiſme the <hi>waſhing of the new birth</hi> vnto vs, and the <hi>renuing of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Sacramentally it is, but effectually it is not, vnleſſe by the power of the ſpirit of ſanctification the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſinne be deſtroyed in vs, that it may not reigne in vs, and the life of God be renued in vs, that we may liue vnto God in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. Neither doth it in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed at all profit vs, to be ſealed outwardly with the ſeale of an holy profeſſion, vnleſſe by the power of the ſpirit we be ſanctified in the inner man, to lead our liues in all godlineſſe and holineſſe: for vnto theſe onely Chriſt Ieſus is <hi>made of God wiſdome, and righteouſnes, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and redemption,</hi> and theſe onely are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that imputed holines, which properly is in Chriſt Ieſus, and is imputed vnto them which are in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. And this is it which indeed makes vs holy, and <hi>ſaints in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Our inherent holineſſe is vtterly vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, full of vnholineſſe, and all ſhall be perfit in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. Yet is it ſo accepted with God thorow Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, that hauing it, his is imputed vnto vs, whereby we are made <hi>Saints in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> So that if as we are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:599:20"/> called, and as by outward profeſſion through baptiſme we are <hi>Saints in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> ſo we will truly be <hi>Saints in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> We muſt follow after holineſſe, and be filled with the fruits of righteouſnes, which are by Ieſus Chriſt vnto the glory and praiſe of God, this inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe onely being the pledge and ſeale of that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted holineſſe, whereby we are moſt truly <hi>Saints in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A good leſſon for all them to meditate vpon, that are baptized into the name of Chriſt Ieſus; but whereon it may well ſeeme, that a great many of vs neuer thinke. For if we did, could it be that we ſhould ſo wallow in ſin, and drinke iniquitie like water as we doe? that wee ſhould ſo defile our ſelues with adulterie, fornication, vncleanneſſe, wantonnes, hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, enuy, theft, murther, drunkennes, gluttony, pride, lying, ſwearing, and the like, as we doe that we ſhould ſo profane the Lords Sabboths, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from the works of the ſpirit, and ſo delight our ſelues in the works of the fleſh as we doe? <hi>Know yee not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3,</note> 
                     <hi>that all we which haue beene baptized into Ieſus Chriſt haue beene baptized into his death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed vp from the dead by the glory of the father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo we alſo ſhould walke in newnes of life?</hi> Surely either we know it not, or remember it not, and whether ſoeuer it be, it argueth that we are not the men that we ſhould be. Beloued, ſinne and ſaints ſort not together. If ye ſuffer <hi>ſinne to reigne in your mortall bodies,</hi> well may the filth of the fleſh be put away through the outward waſhing, but yee are not indeed of the <hi>communion of Saints,</hi> becauſe not waſhed by the ſpirit, in the <hi>ſpirit of your mindes.</hi> Let no man therefore deceiue himſelfe. Either yee muſt be <hi>Saints in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> or elſe yee belong not to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And if yee be <hi>Saints,</hi> then may ye not ſuffer <hi>ſin to reigne in your mortall bodies.</hi> Flie therefore from ſinne, as from a ſerpent, and <hi>follow after peace with all men, and holineſſe, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> So ſhall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:599:20"/> yee not onely be of the number of them that are called <hi>Saints</hi> through the body of their outward profeſhon, but yee ſhall be indeed <hi>Saints in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>

                  <p>Here then 1. in that the Apoſtle writeth as to the whole Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> ſo particularly vnto the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> there, I obſerue that as admonitions, exhortations, inſtructions, conſolations, and the like, are continually needfull for the Church for the further buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof in perfit beauty, ſo are they likewiſe need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the miniſters of the Church, and all others any way intereſſed therein, for their farther confirmation in the things that belong vnto their peace. Wherevpon it was that our Apoſtle going bound in the ſpirit vnto <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> called the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and exhorted them ſaying, <hi>Take heede vnto your ſelues,</hi>

They were miniſters of the goſpell, ſet ouer their flocks, and well inſtructed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here then 1. is a good leſſon for them that are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt eminent in the Church, I meane for the

                  <p>My ſecond obſeruation hence is from this, that there were now <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> there vnto whom hee might write. For hence I obſerue the great bleſſing of the Lord vpon the preaching of the word. A litle while before at the firſt preaching thereof vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> it was ſo vnſauory vnto them, that they could not brooke <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> but caſt them into priſon: but now ſuch a bleſſing the Lord had giuen vnto the word
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:599:22"/> preached by them, that the number of conuerts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers was very great, inſomuch that now they had <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> to attend on teaching, and <hi>Deacons</hi> to attend on diſtribution, and an abſolute eccleſiaſticall gouernment as it may ſeeme amongſt them. This was the Lords his doing:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</note> for <hi>Paul plants, and Apollos waters, but God giues the increaſe.</hi> And this <hi>increaſe</hi> he giueth as it pleaſeth him, ſometimes ſooner, ſometimes later. Vpon one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of <hi>Peter there were added vnto the Church about three thouſand ſoules.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.</note> But at other times, and in other places, the ſeede of the word which both he and other of the Apoſtles did ſowe, lay oftentimes a good while in the ground, before it brought forth fruit vnto the Lord. So in this City of <hi>Philippi, Lydia</hi> at the firſt receiued the word gladly:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14.</note> but in others it tooke roote downeward, and ſprung vp afterward, howſoeuer ſooner or later, as in the primitiue Church through the Apoſtles doctrine, the Lord <hi>added to the Church</hi> from day to day <hi>ſuch as ſhould be ſaued;</hi> ſo doth he alwaies make a bleſſing to follow vpon the word, though vnto vs it ſeeme often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to periſh. So he promiſed long ſince that hee would,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.10,</note> ſaying, <hi>Surely as the raine commeth downe and the ſnow from heauen, &amp; returneth not thither but watereth the earth, and maketh it to bring forth and bud that it may giue ſeede to the ſower, and bread to him that eateth; ſo ſhall my word be that goeth out of my mouth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">11.</note> 
                     <hi>it ſhall not returne vnto me voide, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I will, and it ſhall proſper in the thing wherevnto I ſent it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then is a great comfort ouer our labors in our miniſterie with you that heare vs. Though the word which we bring vnto you be reiected and deſpiſed, and we reviled and perſecuted, yet we faint not but are full of comfort, becauſe we know that the Lord will giue a bleſſing vnto his word. Which howſoeuer it doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies appeare vnto vs, yet ſhall it and doth at one time or other, breake forth into the fruits of holineſſe and a ſauing knowledge in as many as are ordeined vnto life
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:599:22"/> And ſtill wee know this, that his word alwaies doth his will, and proſpereth in that wherevnto it is ſent; ſo that this bleſſing alwaies followes vpon it, that Gods name is thereby glorified, whether it be in them that be ſaued, or in them that periſh. For as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15,</note> 
                     <hi>We are vnto God the ſweet ſauour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaued, and in them that periſh.</hi>

                     <hi>To the one we are the ſauor of death vnto death, and to the other we are the ſauor of life vnto life.</hi> And let this ſuffice for the inſcription.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the ſalutation, wherein the Apoſtle wiſheth the <hi>Philippians</hi> all good from him which is the author of all goodnes. And 1. is ſet downe the thing which hee wiſheth vnto them, <hi>grace and peace,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by <hi>grace</hi> the free fauour of God wherewith hee loueth his children, and by <hi>peace</hi> euery bleſſing corporall and ſpirituall flowing from that fountaine of grace. 2. Is ſet downe vnto whom he wiſheth this <hi>grace and peace,</hi> viz: <hi>to all the Saints at Philippi, with the Biſhops &amp;c.</hi> 3. Is ſet downe the author from whom and by whom he wiſheth this <hi>grace and peace</hi> vnto them, which is <hi>from God our Father</hi> as the fountaine and firſt originall, from whom commeth <hi>euery good and perfit gift;</hi> and <hi>from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as the meanes whereby euery grace of the ſpirit is conveyed and deriued vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle wiſheth <hi>grace and peace</hi> vnto the <hi>Philippians.</hi> The recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued manner of ſalutation among the Iewes was this, <hi>Peace be vnto you.</hi> So <hi>Amaſia</hi> vnto <hi>Dauid, Peace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12.18.</note> 
                     <hi>peace be vnto thee, and peace be vnto thine helpers.</hi> So the Lord vnto <hi>Gideon, Peace be vnto thee.</hi> So Chriſt vnto his Diſciples,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iud.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.36.110.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Peace be vnto you.</hi> So hee taught his Diſciples to ſay, <hi>Peace be to this houſe,</hi> wherein they wiſhed all proſperity and good to them whom they ſo ſaluted. But after the full and cleare manifeſtation of grace in the whole my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our redemption, ſtill we ſee the Apoſtles ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to be, <hi>grace and peace be with you.</hi> Wherein they doe not onely comprehend all bleſſings abſolutely that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:599:23"/> are to be praied for, whether for this life or that that is to come, but plainly demonſtrate the fountaine whence all other bleſſings doe flow, and which principally is to be praied for, bee it in praier for our ſelues, or for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence then I obſerue, what the things are which we muſt wiſh and pray for to our brethren, if we will wiſh them all good; and they are grace and peace; onely two bleſſings of goodneſſe in ſhew of words, but indeede all the bleſſings of the God of <hi>Iſaac</hi> vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> and his ſeed for euer. For what is grace? It is the loue of the euer-liuing God wherewith he freely loueth and accepteth vs in Chriſt Ieſus. And what is peace? It is principally a tranquillitie and quietneſſe in conſcience, through the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes by the grace and loue of God toward vs; but generally whatſoeuer goodneſſe floweth from grace. Now we ſee the rich treaſures of bleſſings ſtored vp in theſe bleſſings of grace and peace. In the bleſſing of grace, there is giuen that which is the cauſe both of peace, and all good bleſſings whatſoeuer. For whence are our election vnto ſaluation, our vocation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the truth, our adoption into the ſonnes of God, our iuſtification vnto righteouſneſſe, our ſanctification vnto holineſſe, our reconciliation with God, our hope of glorification in the heauens? Whence is it that wee beleeue in the holy Trinitie, that wee are ſtrong in hope, that we loue God and our brethren, that we haue peace with God and our owne conſciences, that we reioyce in the holy Ghoſt, that in our thoughts wee thinke, in our deſires we will, in our actions we doe any thing that is good? Are not all theſe things from the bleſſing of grace? Is not the free fauour and loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus the cauſe of al theſe things? yes ſurely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God loueth vs in his welbeloued, therfore doth he thus enrich vs with ſpirituall graces in heauenly things; and further giueth vs the true poſſeſſion of all temporall bleſſings, of health, wealth, ſtrength, libertie, and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:599:23"/> like, ſo farre as he ſeeth it to be good and needfull for vs. So that in the bleſſing of grace all theſe things are giuen as in the cauſe. Now in the bleſſing of peace, are giuen all the good things themſelues which proceed from that cauſe, whether they bee ſpirituall graces, or temporall bleſſings. For ſo I vnderſtand and conceiue hereof, that in the bleſſing of peace are giuen all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer are either certaine tokens, or probable ſignes of peace with God. So that the ſpirituall graces of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine tokens of our peace with God, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall bleſſings of God being probable ſignes thereof, as aduerſitie and trouble are probable, ſignes vnto man of Gods diſpleaſure, euen all theſe are giuen in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of peace. What bleſſing then of God can wee wiſh or pray for to our brethren which is not treaſured vp in the bleſſings of grace and peace, the one being the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all good things, and the other being the good things themſelues; the one releaſing vs from ſinne, the other freeing vs from an euill conſcience, the onely two Fiends that trouble and torment vs?</p>
                  <p>Will yee then learne in a briefe and ſhort ſumme, to comprehend whatſoeuer bleſſing is needful to be praied for for your brethren? I think ye will be willing, for long praiers either for them, or for your ſelues is very weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto you; pray then for grace and peace vnto them: Firſt for grace, then for peace: for vnto whom grace is giuen, peace ſhall be granted; but if grace bee not firſt, peace ſhall not follow, no more then the ſtreames runne where the fountaine is dried vp.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this Apoſtolicall ſalutation I obſerue a moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimonie of the Apoſtles loue towards the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, and conſequently of their loue toward their brethren that vſe it. For, beloued, how can I giue a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtimonie of my loue towards you, then if with the Apoſtle I ſay vnto you, <hi>Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father &amp;c.</hi> Can I pray better for you then when I pray that the grace of God may abound towards you,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:599:24"/> that the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus may be manifeſt in you? Can I wiſh you better then when I wiſh that you may haue peace with God, peace within your ſelues, &amp; peace one with another? Can I deſire better things at the hands of God for you, then that the grace of God may continually preuent and follow you, and that thence all ſpirituall graces and temporall bleſſings may be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto you, both for this life, and that that is to come? Or can mine affection of loue bee more enflamed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, then when thus I poure out my ſoule for you, that ſo by grace ye may be releaſed from ſinne, and the puniſhment thereof, and by peace from the pitifull throbbes of a tormenting conſcience? Did not <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets thus manifeſt their loue vnto the people of God, by praying for them, and wiſhing all good things vnto them? Did not our bleſſed Sauiour thus ſhew his loue towards his Apoſtles, and all them that ſhould belieue through their preaching, when hee made that long praier for them?<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.</note> And thus ſhould wee teſtifie our loue vnto our brethren, euen by Chriſtian ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, holy praiers, and heartie wiſhes for grace and peace vnto them from God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch teſtimonies are not now common: Nay hee that ſhall now giue ſuch a teſtimonie of his loue vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his brethren by ſuch a forme of ſalutation, he ſhall be ſure to be noted for his paines, and odiouſly to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Whereof as I ſee no reaſon, ſo neither do I think it meet, that this be the forme of ſalutation whatſoeuer be the ſubiect and matter of our writing. But to let that paſſe, is it not ſo, that there are ſtrifes, debates, enuyings, hatreds, contentions, and diuiſions amongſt vs? Is it not ſo that we wound &amp; kill one another, if not with ſwords, yet with tongues whet like ſwords, faſtening lies, and ſlaunders, and ſuſpitions one vpon another? Is it not ſo that we rather eate and deuoure one another, then wiſh one an others good? yes ſurely, the godly man may now
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:599:24"/> ſorrow with <hi>Dauid</hi> and ſay, <hi>woe is me that I am conſtrained to dwell with Meſech,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 120.4.5.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and to haue mine habitation among the tents of Kedar. My ſoule hath long dwelt among them that be enemies vnto peace. I labour for peace, but when I ſpeake vnto them thereof they make them readie to battell.</hi> And is it ſo with vs, and can wee ſay that wee are ſo affectioned one vnto another, as that wee wiſh grace and peace from God one vnto another? Nay, well may wee flatter our ſelues, but in truth we cannot ſay ſo. For as they onely loue God that loue their brethren, ſo they onely wiſh peace from God vnto their brethren, that loue to liue in peace with their brethren. Beloued, wee are brethren: why ſhould we then ſtriue one with another? Why then ſhould there be heart-burnings in one againſt another? Rather we ſhould be at peace one with another, and wiſh grace and peace from God one vnto another. Thus did the Apoſtle, and herein left an example for vs to follow, that as he walked in loue towards all the Saints in Chriſt Ieſus, ſo we alſo ſhould walke in loue one towards an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let therefore the ſame minde bee in vs that was in our Apoſtle, and let vs from our very ſoules wiſh grace and peace from God one vnto another. Let our gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings be with holy praiers, for abundance of al the Lords mercies vnto our brethren, and ſo let vs teſtifie our lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affection towards them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In this Apoſtolicall ſalutation I obſerue a briefe ſum of Chriſtian religion, in the vſing whereof we ſhew forth a moſt notable teſtimonie of our faith. I can only note the points of Chriſtianitie briefly which it conteineth, and muſt leaue the ſerious conſideration and meditation of them vnto your ſelues. The 1. point is, that all bleſſings, whether ſpirituall graces or temporall bleſſings beſtowed vpon vs, are from God the father by Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne. So alſo ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Euery good giuing, and euery perfit gift is from aboue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.</note> 
                     <hi>and commeth downe from the father of lights, with whom is no variableneſſe, neither ſhadowing by turning.</hi> And ſo wee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:599:25"/> confeſſe when we pray for <hi>grace and peace,</hi> whereby all bleſſings are ſignified vnto our brethren <hi>from God our Father &amp;c.</hi> His name therefore for euery bleſſing we haue is to be bleſſed and praiſed for euer, and that ſong of <hi>Dauid</hi> is of all Gods children to be taken vp, <hi>Praiſe thou the Lord ô my ſoule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.</note> 
                     <hi>and all that is within me praiſe his holy name; praiſe the Lord ô my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond point is, that onely God is to be prayed vnto for all bleſſings by Ieſus Chriſt. So our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour hath taught vs, where he teacheth vs thus to pray, <hi>Our father which art in heauen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo we confeſſe when we pray for <hi>grace and peace</hi> vnto our brethren <hi>from God our Father &amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid vnto Chriſt, <hi>to whom ſhall we goe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.68.</note> 
                     <hi>thou haſt the words of eternall life?</hi> ſo I ſay, to whom ſhould we pray for any bleſſing? <hi>Euery good giuing, and euery perfit gift is from aboue &amp;c.</hi> as euen now we heard out of <hi>Iames.</hi> Friuolous therefore and impious is the invocation of Saints, whereby that honor is taken from God, which is chiefly due, and properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto him, I meane prayer. For <hi>how ſhall any man call on him in whom he doth not beleeue?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom</hi> 10.14.</note> Or in whom ſhall any man beleeue but in God onely? So then if onely we be to beleeue in God, then are we only to pray vnto God, and therefore not vnto Saints.</p>
                  <p>The third point is, that the grace, and free fauour of God in Chriſt Ieſus, is the very fountaine of all Gods bleſſings beſtowed vpon vs. So the Holy Ghoſt witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth throughout the whole ſcripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</note> ſaying, that <hi>we are iuſtified freely by grace,</hi> that <hi>we are ſaued by grace,</hi> and that <hi>by the grace of God we are that we are</hi> whatſoeuer we be, and whatſoeuer bleſſing we haue. And ſo we confeſſe in effect, when we pray firſt for <hi>grace</hi> and then for <hi>peace.</hi> that from <hi>grace</hi> as the fountaine, may flow <hi>peace</hi> and all the riuers of Gods bleſſings. Mans merits therefore muſt ſtand aſide, we may not hold any bleſſing of them, but onely of grace. For as the Apoſtle diſputeth of <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:599:25"/> ſo may it be ſaid of any bleſſing of God; <hi>if it be of grace, it is not of works, elſe were grace no more grace;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:599:26"/> words, <hi>vnto God, euen our Father, &amp;c.</hi> I told you, that it was obſerued, that not any ſaith with <hi>Chriſt</hi> my Father, as many ſay with <hi>Thomas, my Lord my God.</hi> And ſo in deed it is obſerued by <hi>Zanchius</hi> on thoſe words. But ſince I perceiue by as faithfull and diligent an obſeruer of the ſcriptures,<note place="margin">Dr. Rain. Iob <hi>34.36.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaking vnto God ſaith, <hi>my Father let Iob be tried &amp;c.</hi> not indeed in our Engliſh tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, following the iudgement of ſome of the Rabbins, but yet in the beſt approued Tranſlations. So that it may not be a rule that none may ſay with Chriſt, <hi>my Father;</hi> but as we ſay, <hi>my God,</hi> and <hi>our God,</hi> ſo may we ſay, <hi>my Father,</hi> and <hi>our Father.</hi> And herein is the ſweet comfort of all Gods children, that we may cry vnto God <hi>Abba,</hi> which is <hi>Father;</hi> that we may pray and ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> that we may wiſh <hi>grace and peace from God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> for if he be our Father, and we his ſonnes, then are we alſo <hi>heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt.</hi> And let all the comforts in the world ſtoupe vnto this one comfort, the very ſoules ioy of all them that haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſpirit of adoption.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt point is, that Chriſt Ieſus our Lord is our onely Mediator, by whom onely we haue acceſſe in our prayers vnto God, and by whom we receiue whatſoeuer we haue of God.

                  <p>The moſt of the reſt of the points I will conclude in one which is this, that Ieſus Chriſt is God, which wee confeſſe when we pray for <hi>grace and peace</hi> from him; that he is the Sauiour of the world, which we confeſſe when we call him <hi>Ieſus;</hi> that he is that counſeller and great prophet, that King and Prince of peace, that lambe of God ſlaine from the beginning of the world to take away the ſinne of the world, which we confeſſe when we call him <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that vnto him is giuen all power in heauen and in earth, which we confeſſe when we call him <hi>Lord.</hi> If he therefore <hi>be with vs we neede not to feare who be againſt vs.</hi> For he is our God, our Sauiour, our Lord, our Maſter, our King, our euerlaſting high Prieſt.

Out of the abundance of his heart his mouth ſpake, and ſtill his mouth was filled with <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> inſomuch that three ſeuerall times ſtill he ingeminates <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, Paul and Timothie the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, to all the ſaints in Ieſus Chriſt, grace
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:599:27"/> be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Which argueth that his comfort was in him, that his loue was ſet on him, and that he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as the ſpouſe ſpeaketh in the Canticles, <hi>the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of ten thouſand.</hi>

                        <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10.</note> Hence then I obſerue a rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by commonly to diſcerne what a man is, his ſpeach commonly bewraieth what he is. The worldling his tongue is ſtill talking of the world, the couetous man of his money, the voluptuous man of his pleaſure, the proud man of his rich attire, the delicate man of his dainty fare, the pot-companion of his cups, and the like, commonly talke moſt of the things they like beſt; and by their talke commonly they may bee diſcerned what they are. And in this reſpect as it is with them that ſet their affections on things which are on earth, ſo is it with them that ſet their affections on the things which are aboue. They are ſtill talking of the word of their ſaluation, of the commandements of the Lord, of the mercies of the Lord, and of the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto their peace; as <hi>Dauid</hi> profeſſeth of himſelfe ſaying,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>My ſong ſhall be of mercy and iudgement: with my lips doe I ſpeake of all the iudgements of thy mouth: I talke of thy commandments, and haue reſpect vnto thy waies: I will talke of thy worſhip ô Lord, thy glory, thy praiſe, and wondrous workes, my tongue ſhall be talking of thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe all the day long, and I will tell of thy ſaluation from day to day.</hi> But of all other things their delight is, in their hearts to muſe, and with their tongues to talke of Ieſus Chriſt. Here their hearts dance for ioy, and the talking hereof is more ſweet then hony and the hony-combe vnto their mouthes. Hereon they loue, as it were, to dwell, and their tongues can neuer be ſatisfied with talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him. And why? here is their comfort, here is their hope, here is their loue, here is their <hi>crowne of reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</hi> Here is their protector in all dangers, their reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vnto God, their mediator betweene God and them, their Sauiour from their ſinnes, and he that is <hi>made of

Thus the children of God loue to talke of him whom their ſoule loueth, and thus commonly a man may diſcerne who are <hi>ſaints in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Commonly I ſay, not euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more certainely. For if good ſpeech, and holy talke, and crying <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and often vſing of the name of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> were a perpetuall and certaine rule of a good Chriſtian, the diſſembling hypocrite would be as good a Chriſtian as the beſt. And a hard matter it is not to be deceiued ſometimes by the hypocrite. But commonly, I ſay, a mans ſpeach bewraieth what he is, holy, or pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fane. The ground of which note is that ſaying of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.34.</note> that <hi>of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:</hi> and otherwiſe we cannot iudge whereon the heart thinketh, but by that whereon the tongue runneth.</p>
                  <p>Hence then learne you, beloued, to make tryall vnto your ſelues, and to giue tryall vnto others, what yee are Your tongue and talke may tell your ſelues, and doe tell others, what yee are. What is it whereon your tongues loue moſt to talke, and wherein yee take moſt pleaſure when yee talke? Is it on the things which are on earth? It may be a token vnto your ſelues and others that yee are earthly minded. Is it on the things which are aboue? It may be a token vnto your ſelues and others that your converſation is in heauen. If yee loue <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> if yee take comfort in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> your tongues will be talking
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:599:28"/> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and your hearts will reioyce, when your tongues are talking of him. As therefore the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſo doe I you, <hi>Let your ſpeach be gracious alwaies,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I thanke my God]</hi> After the inſcription and ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, now followeth the body of the Epiſtle it ſelfe: wherein the principall ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle is to confirme the <hi>Philippians</hi> in the truth wherein they ſtood, that they might not onely not decreaſe, but increaſe in all knowledge, and in all iudgement. In this <hi>exordium</hi> or beginning of his Epiſtle, which is from <hi>verſe</hi> 3. to 12. to teſtifie his loue toward the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that ſo they might the rather hearken vnto him; 1. he ſignifieth his reioycing on their behalfe for the grace of God already beſtowed on them. 2. he ſignifieth his aſſured hope of Gods farther mercy towards them in performing the good worke which he had begun in them. 3. he prayeth for their perſeuerance, &amp; increaſe in all knowledge and in all godlines. His reioycing on their behalfe he ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1. in his giuing of thanks vnto God on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. 2. in remembring them in his prayers vnto God. 3. in praying for them with gladneſſe. The grace of God already beſtowed on them, for which he reioyced in their behalfe, is ſaid to be, 1. their fellowſhip with other Churches in the goſpell. 2. their perſeuerance therein from the firſt day they had receiued the goſpell, till now that he wrote vnto them. This is the generall reſolution of theſe words.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:599:28"/>
                  <p>Now for the more particular opening of the meaning of them, in that in the beginning of his Epiſtle, hee <hi>thanketh God</hi> on the <hi>Philippians</hi> behalfe, he obſerueth his vſuall manner. For ſo he beginneth almoſt all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as anon we ſhall heare. In that he ſaith, that <hi>hee thanketh his God,</hi> he ſignifieth his bold, and neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vnto God in giuing thanks, and in praying vnto him. Againe, in that he ſaith, that <hi>he hath them in perfect memory alwaies in all his prayers for them all,</hi> he meaneth that as alwaies he thanketh God for them all, ſo alwaies in all his prayers vnto God he remembreth them. And he addeth that his prayers are alwaies powred out vnto God for them with <hi>great ioy and gladneſſe</hi> of heart. Why? <hi>becauſe,</hi> as he addeth the reaſon, <hi>of the fellowſhip which they had receiued in the Goſpell.</hi> 1. Becauſe they, as other Churches had receiued the goſpell, and thereby had fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father, and with his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt; and becauſe they had continued in the truth from the firſt day of their conuerſion vnto Chriſt, by his miniſtery vntill now that he wrote vnto them. This was the cauſe of his thankſgiuing; and his continuall prayers, wherein he alwaies remembred them, were, that they might continue in that grace, euen in that fellowſhip which they had receiued in the goſpell. It is then briefly as if the Apoſtle had thus ſaid, <hi>I thanke my God alwaies on your behalfe, for that fellowſhip which you haue with the Father, and the Sonne, with vs, and with other Churches by embracing the Goſpell, and for your perſeuerance therein from the firſt day that I, and Silas, and Timotheus preached it vnto you vnto now, and alwaies in all my praiers vnto God I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, praying for you, with gladnes for the grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted you, that yee may continue and increaſe in that grace.</hi> This I take to be the meaning of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing then which here I note is, the Apoſtles beginning of his Epiſtle with thankſgiuing vnto God on the <hi>Philippians</hi> behalfe. And ſo he beginneth all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles with thankſgiuing vnto God on their behalfe to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:599:29"/> whom he wrote, onely his Epiſtles to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and to <hi>Titus,</hi> and the former to <hi>Timothy</hi> excepted. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> beginneth his former Epiſtle. Whence I obſerue, that thankſgiuing vnto God is a ſeruice principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a Chriſtian. <hi>I exhort,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that firſt of all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</note>

                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 7.12.</note> if we looke into the practiſe of the ſaints of God, we ſhall finde that they were neuer ſlacke in this ſeruice. <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> after <hi>Abrahams</hi> victory ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not this ſeruice,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.20.</note> but gaue thanks vnto the moſt high God which had deliuered his enemies into his hand. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after their deliuerance from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1.</note> and out of the red ſea, ſlacked not this ſeruice, but ſung praiſes vnto the Lord. So did <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> and <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> and many others after their victories ouer their enemies. And how often doe we read that, as others of his ſeruants, ſo our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himſelfe gaue thanks vnto his father? All which ſhew clearely how requiſite this ſeruice of thankſgiuing vnto God is, if either we will hearken to the precepts and exhortations of the Holy Ghoſt, or doe as we haue the ſaints of God, and our bleſſed Sauiour for example.</p>
                  <p>What then? Doth the Lord neede the praiſes of man, or is he delighted with his giuing of thanks? No, the Lord needeth them not, neither is he delighted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſo much for his owne ſake. Yet doth hee require them of vs, and is delighted therewith for our ſakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for 1. in giuing of thanks vnto God, we acknowledge that to be from him, for which we giue him thanks. 2. In gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him thanks, we ſhew our ſelues well pleaſed and content with that ſpirituall grace or temporall bleſſing wherefore wee giue him thanks. 3. In giuing him
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:599:29"/> thanks, we returne what wee can vnto the Lord, with humble confeſſion that we can no more, nor that but by grace. Laſtly, in giuing of thanks vnto God, wee pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoke him to beſtow farther mercies vpon vs. All which things he requireth of vs, and liketh well in vs. And for theſe very reaſons, beſides the former, is thankſgiuing vnto God ſo requiſite a ſeruice in a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Yet as requiſite a ſeruice as it is, we faile aſmuch in it as in any ſeruice. It may be, that being in perill, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or ſorrow, or neede, or ſicknes, or other like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie we will make our requeſts knowne vnto God in prayer and ſupplication, as the occaſions are publiquely or priuately. But when the Lord hath heard our pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers, and gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I note is, the cauſe of the Apoſtles thankſgiuing vnto God, which is, becauſe of the fellowſhip which they had in the goſpell from the firſt day vntill then; 1. becauſe they as other Churches had receiued the goſpell, whereby they had fellowſhip with the Father, and the Sonne, and becauſe they had continued in the truth from the firſt day of their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vnto Chriſt by the worke of his miniſterie vnto now that he wrote vnto them. Whence I obſerue a principall matter of our thankſgiuing vnto God, a principall cauſe why we ſhould, vpon the bleſſing beſtowed vpon vs, giue thanks vnto God for it. In all things indeed is matter of our thankſgiuing vnto God. for <hi>euery good giuing and euery perfit gift is from aboue,</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:599:30"/> to offer vnto him the ſacrifice of praiſe &amp; thankſgiuing. But yet is a more principall matter behind, which is the fellowſhip which wee haue with other reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and the continuance thereof ſo long time amongſt vs, the preaching of the word of our ſaluation amongſt vs, and the bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereof vnder a moſt gracious gouernment. Here is indeed principall cauſe of reioycing, and thankſgiuing. for by our fellowſhip which we haue with other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the goſpell, we haue fellowſhip with the Father, and with his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, as <hi>Iohn</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>that which we haue ſeene and heard,</hi> to wit the goſpell,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3.</note>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:599:31"/> which trouble you, and intrude to peruert the goſpell of Chriſt, what a principall bleſſing is this of our good God vnto vs? Surely theſe are ſuch bleſſings, as may well make vs breake out into exclamation with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſay,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>What ſhall I render vnto the Lord for theſe his great mercies towards me? I will receiue the cup of ſaluation, and call vpon the name of the Lord.

                  <p>Haue we then ſuch principall cauſe of thankſgiuing vnto our God for the fellowſhip which wee haue with other Churches in the goſpell, and for the continuance of this fellowſhip from the firſt day vnto now, euen theſe forty yeares? This then 1. ſhould teach vs, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and gladly to embrace the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, when it is brought vnto vs. For if there be ſuch cauſe of thankſgiuing vnto God for it being had, then ſurely is there great cauſe of gladly embracing it, when it may be had. And yet what dullneſſe, and ſlacknes, and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes herein? In this congregation how is it embraced? I beare you record ſome of you, that yee doe embrace it willingly and gladly, and I aſſure my ſelfe that from your hearts you thanke your God for it. But others there are that ſeldome or neuer come vnto the hearing of it; others that when they ſhould heare it turne their backs, and depart away from the hearing of it; others that heare it ſleepingly, or coldly, ſo that either it enters not in, or quickly after is choked by the cares of this world. Do theſe thanke God for the fellowſhip which they haue with others in the goſpell? Nay they haue none, and ſome of them will haue no fellowſhip with others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and therefore vnleſſe at length they take hold of the grace that is offered them, they ſhall haue no fellowſhip with the Father, or with Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne. As for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:599:31"/> you, beloued, that gladly embrace the goſpell of your ſaluation, hold on your good courſe, thirſt after it as the Hart doth after the water brooks, frequent the places where yee may heare it, lay it vp in your hearts, that yee may not ſinne againſt the Lord, and let your mouthes be euer filled with praiſes &amp; thankſgiuing to God for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach vs to labour by all holy meanes to continue in the grace, and in the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſtand vnto the end. For if it ſhould ſo principally cauſe in vs thankſgiuing vnto God, then ſhould it alſo worke in vs all holy deſire and labour, to be daily more and more ſtabliſhed and ſtrengthned in the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, and in our fellowſhip with other Churches in the goſpell. And yet how wauering are we many of vs, and how quickly caried about with euery winde of doctrine by the deceit of men, and with craftineſſe whereby they lay in waite to deceiue? If a runnagate Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie that compaſſeth ſea and land to make one of his profeſſion, and when he is made, makes him twofold more the childe of hell then he himſelfe is, a ſworne-vaſſall to that man of ſinne, a diſloyall traitor to his Prince, an vnnaturall enemy to his country, if ſuch a one I ſay, ſhall with fained words creepe into ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners amongſt vs, and gloſingly ſlander the truth of the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſet abroche his owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hereſies, how quickly doe we liſten vnto them, and are led captiue by them? Howſoeuer it be with vs, it is thus in too too many places. But, beloued, let vs know that whoſoeuer tranſgreſſeth and <hi>abideth not in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt hath not God.</hi>

                     <hi>receiue him not to houſe, neither bid him, God ſpeede.</hi> I know they will tell you they bring the doctrine of Chriſt vnto you; but doe yee as the men of <hi>Beraea</hi> did,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.</note> which are much commended for ſo doing, examine it by the ſcriptures, and <hi>ſearch whether it be ſo,</hi> and yee ſhall finde it to be

                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and as euen by that place it will appeare to be. Wherefore, beloued brethren, as now yee haue fellowſhip with other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo continue therein: Let nothing bee able to remoue you from the truth wherein yee ſtand, but hold faſt your <hi>good profeſſion</hi> vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which here I note is, the Apoſtles bold, and neere, and ioyfull approch vnto God in his thankſgiuing vnto God, in that he ſaith, <hi>I thanke my God.</hi> Whence I obſerue the manner of our thankſgiuing vnto God, how we ſhould offer our ſacrifice of thankſgiuing vnto him: And that is, 1. with ſuch aſſurance of Gods loue in his mercies towards vs, as that in our thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for them we dare boldly as ſonnes ſay, <hi>I thanke my God.</hi> for ſo ſhall our ſacrifice of thankſgiuing be accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table vnto God, if vpon aſſurance of his loue we boldly powre out our ſoules in praiſe vnto him. And therefore the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> exhorteth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 4 16.</note> ſaying, <hi>Let vs go boldly vnto the throne of grace,</hi> be it in prayer, or in thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, <hi>Let vs goe boldly vnto the throne of grace, praying and giuing thanks vnto God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> 2. Our thankſgiuing ſhould be offered with ſuch willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and cheerefullneſſe from our hearts vnto God, that we might ſay, <hi>I thanke my God.</hi> So our Apoſtle in an other place,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.18.</note> 
                     <hi>I thanke my God, I ſpake languages more then yee all.</hi> How cheerefully he openeth his mouth in praiſe of his God. And ſo ſhall our thankſgiuing be pleaſing vnto God, if we offer it from the heart cheerefully; for <hi>he loueth a cheerefull giuer,</hi> as of almes vnto the poore Saints, ſo of thanks vnto his name. And how can I goe vnto him with greater cheerefullneſſe and thanke him, then when I go vnto him as to my God, and ſay, <hi>I thanke my God?</hi> 3. Our thankſgiuing vnto God ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp with ſuch ſoule-melting paſſion and affection, that as if we had greater feeling experience in our ſoules of his goodnes then others, and would be neerer him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:599:32"/> then others, we ſhould ſay, <hi>I thanke my God.</hi> for ſuch the Lord loueth beſt as preſſe the neereſt vnto him, and then the ſacrifice of praiſe pleaſeth moſt where the ſoule is tied the cloſeſt vnto his God. Theſe are the things in which the manner how we ſhould offer vp our ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of thankſgiuing conſiſteth, namely in faith and full aſſurance of Gods loue towards vs, with all willingneſſe and cheerefulneſſe from our hearts, and with a ſoule-rauiſht affection, as of a more then ordinarie feeling-experience of Gods goodnes towards vs. And this manner I take it may bee obſerued from this that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I thanke my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then that cold and curſorie forme of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing which commonly is vſed is vtterly condemned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what doe wee when the Lord hath remembred vs in mercy, and done great things for vs? I doubt not but there are who in their hearts cheerefully, and with their mouthes ioyfully ſay with the Prophet, <hi>thou art my God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.28.</note> 
                     <hi>and I will thanke thee, thou art my God, and I will praiſe thee.</hi> But a great many of vs like <hi>vnto horſes and mules which haue no vnderſtanding</hi> either remember not, or regard not to giue God thanks. A man may ſee it daily in many of vs, that we come from our beds, and from our meales, as dogs from their kennels, and oxen from their ſtalls. Others of vs haue certaine words of courſe, as to ſay, <hi>God be bleſſed, God be thanked, I praiſe God, I thanke God,</hi> which being good words in themſelues, yet are ſo coldly and curſorily vttered by vs, as that a man may well ſee they haue their beginning in the lips, and their ending in the ayre, but neuer pierce the heauens. But beloued, if we will haue our voice of thankſgiuing to breake tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the clouds, &amp; to come vnto the higheſt, we muſt vſe <hi>Maries magnificat,</hi> and ſay, <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit reioyceth in God my Sauiour.</hi>

For be it our predeſtination, our election, our adoption, our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, our iuſtification, which are as ſure vnto all the ſonnes of God as that God is true, yet euen in reſpect of theſe haue we neede alwaies to pray that the aſſurance of them may be daily more and more ſealed vnto our ſpirits by the pledge of Gods ſpirit.

                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note is, that the Apoſtle in his praiers for the <hi>Philippians</hi> praied for them all: for ſo he ſaith, that <hi>he had them in perfect memory alwaies in all his prayers &amp;c.</hi> Whence I obſerue, how in our praiers for the Church we ought to be affected towards it, namely, that ſo in our praiers we commend the whole Church vnto God. For what though in the Church, all bee not knit together in one minde and in one iudgment? what though all be not alike forward in acknowledging and embracing the truth? what though many things bee done in the Church through contention, or vaine glory? The Apoſtle knew well that it was thus in the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> as many euidently appeare by ſundry places in this his Epiſtle: yet in his praiers vnto God for them, he tooke no ſuch notice of theſe things, as that he did ſeclude any of them out of his praiers vnto God, but ioyntly he commended them all in his praiers vnto God Right ſo we, in our praiers for the Church, we ſhould not eaſily take notice of euery contention, of euery de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect, of euery thing that may offend in the Church, ſo to ſeclude any out of our praiers vnto God, but in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian affection towards all, and in an holy deſire for all, we ſhould commend the whole Church in our praiers vnto God. It was ſuch an ordinarie practiſe with our Apoſtle, both to giue thanks vnto God for all them to whom he wrote, and likewiſe to pray for them all, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that many things were amiſſe amongſt them, that we are not to doubt, but that we are ſo to doe as we haue the Apoſtle for an enſample. Looke into his Epiſtles, and by the beginning almoſt of all of them, ye ſhall ſee that this was his ordinary practiſe, leauing vs therein an enſample, that as he did ſo we ſhould do. And the reaſon is plaine: for doth not the Apoſtle in writing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:599:35"/> his Epiſtles vnto the Churches, ſtill write as <hi>vnto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of God, and vnto Saints in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> ſtill entituling the whole Church vnto which he wrote, vnto theſe titles without exception of any? Or doth the Apoſtle ſo, and are not we to doe ſo? Or are wee to doe ſo, and not to commend the whole Church in our praiers vnto God? The reaſon I take it inferreth the point, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto vs that generall care of commending the whole Church in our praiers vnto God.</p>
                  <p>A good leſſon, and well worthy the learning of many in theſe our daies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as it fareth more priuately and particularly amongſt men, ſo doth it fare more publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and generally in the Church. Amongſt men ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily euery trifling matter is enough to cut off all loue and friendſhip amongſt vs, nay to breed great hatreds, and enmities amongſt vs, nay to ſet vs at ſuch odds, that rather we will banne and curſe one another, then pray one for another. And if wee differ in iudgement one from another about ſome matters of the Church, then nothing on one part but carnall goſpellers, and time-ſeruers; nothing on another part but ſacrilegious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſchiſmaticall perſons, troublers of the ſtate, and hypocriticall diſſemblers, nothing but ſlandering and forging things neuer writ or ſpoke, nothing but ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſſe, as that it may bee feared that on ſome part there is little praying for the other, vnleſſe it bee to confound them. Neither is it otherwiſe more publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and general<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y in the Church, if we may iudge by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances. Some parts of the Church vnto ſome ſeeme to haue ſo many defects and blemiſhes, ſo many ſuperſtitious rites and ceremonies that they cannot brooke them, they cannot abide in them, they cannot pray with them, I know not whether they doe pray for them. And of others, other parts of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their forme of gouernment, are ſo miſliked, that they cannot with patience heare of them, and therefore it is like do not in all their prayers remember them. But
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:599:36"/> theſe and all ſuch might hence be better leſſoned, and ſuch vncharitableneſſe, if any ſuch be in them, reformed. Let vs, beloued, be <hi>otherwiſe minded.</hi> Howſoeuer there be things amiſſe in the Church, let vs not ſeclude any out of our praiers vnto God, but let vs commend in our praiers the whole Church vnto God. In our praiers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God let vs abandon all cogitation either of priuate quarrells one with another, or of publike contentions in the Church, and let vs pray each for other, and all of vs for the whole Church vnto the Lord feruently. Let the ſame minde bee in vs, that was in our Apoſtle, and let vs alwaies in all our praiers haue <hi>all the ſaints in Christ Ieſus in perfit memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing which here I note is, the thing for which the Apoſtle praied in all his praiers for them; and that was the ſame in ſubſtance with that wherefore <hi>hee gaue thanks vnto God.</hi> For as his thankſgiuing vnto GOD on their behalfe was <hi>becauſe of the fellowſhip which they had in the goſpell from the firſt day vntill then;</hi> ſo his praiers vnto God for them were that they might continue in that fellowſhip which they had in the goſpell vnto the end. Whence I obſerue a very materiall point to be remembred in our praiers vnto God, both for the whole Church, and for our ſelues; which is continuance in the fellowſhip of the goſpell, that our Church may continue in that fellowſhip which it hath with other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in the goſpell, and that we may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue grounded and ſtabliſhed in the truth wherein we ſtand. Here is indeed principall cauſe of proſtrating our ſelues before the throne of grace, and powring out our ſoules in praier vnto our God, whether we looke vnto the curſe in the wanting, or vnto the bleſſing in the enioying of the glorious goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. For what greater curſe or plague of God could fall vpon vs then that our candleſticke ſhould be remoued from vs, that a famine of the word ſhould be ſent amongſt vs, that the goſpell of our ſaluation ſhould be tranſlated from vs to another

                     <hi>for it is the power of God vnto ſaluation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery one that beleeueth.</hi> See then whether here it be not principall cauſe for vs to pray for our Church, that in it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:599:37"/> the goſpell of our ſaluation may for euer be freely and ſincerely preached; and for our ſelues that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that grace wherein we ſtand by the goſpell of our ſaluation. Yes ſurely, if either feare of as great a plague of Gods wrath as can fall vpon vs may force vs to pray, or deſire of as great a bleſſing of God as can befall vs may perſwade vs to pray: we haue great cauſe euen to powre out our ſoules in prayer and ſupplication vnto our God, for the bleſſed continuance of that fellowſhip which we haue with other Churches in the goſpell, that as now, ſo euer this grace may bee continued vpon vs. Yea beloued, if yee ſhall but caſt your eyes abroad into the land, yee ſhall finde that there is great cauſe thus to pray. For how doth Atheiſme and abominable irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſpread it ſelfe, and ouer-ſpread the whole face of the land? Hath it not neſtled it ſelfe on hie, and ſaid within it ſelfe, who ſhall bring me downe to the ground? How doth Papiſme and out-worne Pelagianiſme now ſhoote out the head, and breake out in many places, as if now the day approched wherein they may ſay, <hi>ſo, ſo, thus would we haue it?</hi> How hath cunning policie broken the necke of Chriſtianitie, and now ſo ſwaieth that it carieth all almoſt with it? What neglect and contempt of the word is there in all places? And what elſe are theſe but forerunners of a fearefull iudgement to follow? What elſe doe theſe threaten, but the remouing of our candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke from vs? Beloued, ſhall wee ſee and know theſe things, and ſhall wee not pray? Let vs pray at euening and at morning, and at midday; let vs pray and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, that this iudgement may neuer fall vpon vs, that this light of the goſpell may neuer be put out, but that it may ſhine amongſt vs, from generation to generation vntill the day of Chriſt Ieſus. The more that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is, let vs pray the more feruently, and let vs not giue our ſelues any reſt, but ſtill pray vnto the Lord for our continuance which we haue with other reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the goſpell.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:599:37"/>
                  <p>The fourth thing which here I note is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle thus praied for the <hi>Philippians alwaies in all his praiers.</hi> Whence I obſerue with what conſtant aſſiduity and carefullneſſe, we ought to pray for our Church, and for our ſelues, that we may continue in the fellowſhip which we haue in the goſpell: we ſhould neuer pray but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in our praiers, this praier for our Church and for our ſelues ſhould continually be remembred, that the fellowſhip which we now haue with other Churches in the goſpell may for euer be continued vnto vs. To pray alwaies,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Luc.</hi> 18.1.</note> and not to faint or giue ouer is a thing much commanded by the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Continue in prayer,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle. And againe in another place, <hi>Pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe is that parable of the importunate widow in the goſpell. All which places ſhew vs the neceſſitie of praier, that whenſoeuer we ſtand in neede we haue recourſe vnto God by praier, ſo the conſtant perſeuerance that is to be vſed in praier, that howſoeuer for ſome time we ſeeme to pray and bee not heard, yet we faint not, nor giue ouer, but ſtill pray, and that inſtantly. Now as wee are to pray, and to pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, ſo alwaies in all our praiers this is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that we pray that the Lord his way may be knowne vpon earth, and his ſauing health among all nations, that the preaching of the goſpell may bee fruitfull vnto vs, and vnto the whole Church, that the word of the Lord may haue free paſſage, and be glorified, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue grounded and ſtabliſhed in the faith, as wee haue beene taught in Ieſus Chriſt, that we and our whole Church, may continue in the fellowſhip which we haue with other Churches in the goſpell. This the example of our Apoſtle teacheth vs to do, who in that he did for others, left vs an example what to doe for our ſelues, and for others.</p>
                  <p>Yea but is not the Lord alwaies more ready to heare then we are to pray, and hath he not ſaid, that <hi>whoſoeuer asketh receiueth,</hi> that <hi>he that ſeeketh findeth,</hi> and that <hi>to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:599:38"/> him that knocketh it ſhall be opened?</hi> Or if it be ſo, what needeth it alwaies in all our praiers thus to pray as hath beene ſaid? True it is, that whoſoeuer asketh receiueth, and that the Lord is more ready to heare and to grant our requeſts, then we are to pray and call vpon his name. for commonly he preuenteth vs with his bleſſings, and whatſoeuer it is that we haue by praier, he it is that teacheth vs to pray for it as we ought. But ſome things <hi>we aske often and receiue not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe we aske amiſſe:</hi> and ſome things he hath appointed ſo to be granted, if they bee continually asked. And of this ſort is this thing whereof we now ſpeake. Hee will, as it ſhall be for his glory, continue vs in the fellowſhip which wee haue in the goſpell, if wee continue to aske it in faith, and faint not.</p>
                  <p>This then may teach vs, of what weight and moment our continuance in the fellowſhip of the goſpell is. It is not a thing which hapneth by fortune, or which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane policie effecteth, but onely it is of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alwaies in all our praiers we are to pray vnto him for it. Let vs therefore pray vnto the Lord without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for this grace; let vs neuer forget to commenſe this ſuite in our praiers vnto God, let vs alwaies pray for it, and not faint.</p>
                  <p>The fift thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle praied for the <hi>Philippians with gladnes,</hi> becauſe of their growth in godlines, and in the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt by the worke of his miniſtery. Whence I obſerue a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary care which ought to bee in the whole Church, I meane in all them that are taught in the word, and that is, that they ſo profit and increaſe in all knowledge and iudgement, in all godlineſſe and holy conuerſation, that their Paſtors and Teachers may pray for them with gladnes. Such a care it may ſeeme that the <hi>Romanes</hi> had, vnto whom the Apoſtle giueth this teſtimonie, that their <hi>faith which was publiſhed, and their obedience which was come abroad much gladded him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8.</note> Such a care it may ſeeme
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:599:38"/> that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had, vnto whom the Apoſtle giueth this teſtimonie, that though he was <hi>abſent in the fleſh, yet was he preſent with them in the ſpirit, reioycing and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their order, and their ſtedfaſt faith in Chriſt.</hi> And ſuch a care ought all the people of God to haue, that they which <hi>watch for their ſoules as they that muſt giue accounts vnto God for them,</hi> may now pray for them with gladnes, and afterwards giue their accounts for them <hi>with ioy and not with griefe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this care is not common among the people. for where the Paſtor in an holy care for his people praieth for them, he praieth for them in many places <hi>with great heauineſſe;</hi> with heauineſſe I ſay for their neglect and contempt of the word; with heauineſſe for their igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance in the things that belong vnto their peace, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to bee inſtructed therein; with heauineſſe for their vngodly conuerſation, and vnchriſtian walking; with heauineſſe for ſpending his ſtrength in vaine, and for nothing amongſt them. Hee praieth, but his ſoule mourneth, becauſe hee cannot gaine them vnto Chriſt Ieſus; he praieth, but his ſoule mourneth, becauſe they runne, and needs will runne headlong to the deuill. So litle care commonly there is of profiting by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word amongſt them that are taught in the word.</p>
                  <p>Beloued, let it neuer be ſaid ſo of you, but let your care be that they which labor in the word amongſt you may pray for you with gladnes.<note place="margin">

                  <p>But admitting that they pray onely vnto them as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to interceſſors betwixt Chriſt and vs, I demand what commandement or example there is in the ſcripture to warrant vs to pray at all, or to giue thanks at all vnto them.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.8.</note> that <hi>the</hi> 24 <hi>elders fell downe before the Lambe hauing golden violls full of odours, which are the praiers of the ſaints.</hi> But this place maketh no more to this purpoſe then the reſt: for 1. it is a viſion, and no thing ſo done as here is ſet downe; and therefore no cleare argument will hence be drawne. Againe, here is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:599:41"/> nothing ſpoken of the ſaints in heauen: for it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed vpon that the 24 elders repreſent the Church militant here on earth, whoſe converſation is in heauen, whoſe golden violls full of ſweet odours were their own praiers powred out of faithfull hearts vnto the Lord. Laſtly, they ſay that praying one vnto another here on earth to be aſſiſted by their praiers is lawfull, therefore praier vnto Saints in heauen is lawfull. But to this wee anſwer, 1. that to deſire one anothers praiers is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the word, which they grant: but to requeſt the praiers of the Saints departed hath no warrant in the word, howſoeuer they contend the contrary. 2. There is no ſuch reaſon of deſiring the praiers of the Saints in heauen, as of deſiring one anothers praiers: for wee know one anothers neceſſities, but they know not our neceſſities, as hath beene proued. 3. Our praying one for another to be holpen by their praiers is a godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to our brethren, but no religious invocation of them, as by their merits or worthineſſe to bee brought into Gods fauour, ſuch as is praier vnto Saints. And as we are in a Chriſtian ſort to giue thanks one vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for benefits receiued, ſo are we in a Chriſtian ſort to requeſt one anothers praiers. But that religious thankſgiuing, and that religious invocation whereof we now ſpeake are in no ſort due to any but to God. So that the Saints departed not knowing what wee ſay or thinke, nor giuing either grace or glory to vs, nor any way warranted by the ſcripturs to haue ſuch honor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them, we conclude that we are not to pray, or to giue thanks to them.</p>
                  <p>Nay abſolutely we ſay that it is vtterly vnlawfull to pray, or giue thanks to them. For 1. praier and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing are honors onely due vnto the Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble,</hi>

                     <hi>And I am perſwaded]</hi> As before the Apoſtle teſtified his loue toward the <hi>Philippians,</hi> by his reioycing on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe for the grace of God already beſtowed on them, ſo now likewiſe he teſtifieth his loue towards them, by ſignification of his aſſured hope of Gods farther mercy towards them, in their perſeuerance in the ſame grace vnto the end. Where 1. he ſignifieth his aſſured hope of their perſeuerance, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. 2. Hee ſetteth downe the reaſon which cauſed him ſo aſſuredly to hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely their piety, and his loue of them, <hi>v.</hi> 7. 3. He maketh earneſt proteſtation of his loue towards them,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:599:43"/> 
                     <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. For the firſt, the Apoſtle ſheweth his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and aſſured hope of their perſeuerance, when he ſaith, <hi>I am perſwaded of this ſame thing &amp;c.</hi> And cloſely he implieth a reaſon of his confidence, drawne from the conſtant immutabilitie of God in his doings, when hee ſaith, <hi>that he which hath begun &amp;c.</hi> for it is as if hee had thus reaſoned: God is conſtant in his doings, ſo that looke what he beginneth that he finiſheth, therefore I am perſwaded that hee which hath begun this good worke &amp;c. Now it is to be noted that the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>I am perſwaded that God which hath &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>that he which hath begun,</hi> wherby he implieth that the beginning of that, as alſo indeed of euery good worke, was alone from God. for if it had been from any other, then they ſhould not haue vnderſtood him to haue ſpoken of God, when he ſaid, <hi>that he.</hi> Againe, it is to be noted, that the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>I am perſwaded that you which haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun well, ſhall alſo end well,</hi> but <hi>that he which hath begun &amp;c.</hi> grounding his perſwaſion not on their vertue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, but on the conſtant immutabilitie of God which had begun a good worke in them. Now the good worke which he had begun in them was their embracing of the goſpell, whereby they had fellowſhip in the goſpell with other Churches, which was indeed a ſpeciall good work, and ſuch as they that perſecute them in whom God hath begun this good worke, make but vaine braggs of their good works. <hi>I am then,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>perſwaded that he that hath begun this good worke in you</hi> of embracing the goſpell, <hi>will performe it,</hi> .i. will confirme and ſtabliſh you in it, or will finiſh and <hi>perfit it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> when he ſhall come and <hi>change your vile bodies, that they may bee faſhioned like vnto his glorious body:</hi> for albeit by the day of Chriſt, might be ment the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the faithfull die in Chriſt, yet by the day of Chriſt I rather vnderſtand here the day of Chriſt his ſecond comming in the fleſh in the laſt day, as alſo it is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the next chapter <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. becauſe the Apoſtle
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:599:43"/> ſpeaketh not onely of them that then were at <hi>Philippi,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut of the Church alſo which afterward ſhould bee there vntill the ſecond comming of Chriſt. Thus much of the ſenſe of the words.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing then which here I note, is the ground of the Apoſtles confidence of the <hi>Philippians</hi> perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. His ground is, not the <hi>Philippians</hi> vertue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, as if now they were ſo well grounded &amp; ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the faith that they could not but hold out, &amp; keep faſt their good profeſſion vnto the end, but his ground is the conſtant immutabilitie of God, who where he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginneth to worke a good worke, there he maketh an end of it. Whence I obſerue a notable ground of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of all Gods faithfull children in that grace wherein they ſtand: and that is this, he that hath begun a good worke in them will performe it, and confirme them vnto the end. To which purpoſe alſo there are many other places in the holy ſcripture; as where it is ſaid of Chriſt Ieſus,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.1.</note> that <hi>foraſmuch as he loued his owne which were in the world, vnto the end he loued them.</hi> Whence we take that commonly receiued, ſaying, <hi>that whom God loueth once he loueth vnto the end.</hi> And againe, where Chriſt himſelfe ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſoeuer drinketh of the water that I ſhall giue him ſhall neuer be more a thirſt, but the water that I ſhall giue him ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing vp into euerlaſting life.</hi> Here is, but once drinke, and neuer thirſt, once ſanctified by the ſpirit, and neuer vtterly forſaken of the ſpirit. And againe where <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is borne of God ſinneth not,</hi> namely vnto death: and why? <hi>becauſe the ſeede of God remaineth in him,</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hauing once ſeazed vpon him, alwaies abideth in him. And againe, where our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>him that commeth to mee I caſt not away,</hi> once come by faith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.37.</note> no feare of forſaking afterward. And the reaſon is plaine: for <hi>the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.</note> He calleth vs by his goſpell, and giueth vs gifts and graces of his holy ſpirit, not for our owne ſakes, or for any thing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:599:44"/> that he ſeeth or foreſeeth in vs: for then we might well feare a fall and a change; but his gifts are giuen freely by grace according to his good pleaſure. So that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer repenteth of any grace which hee beſtoweth vpon vs, nor ſuffereth his mercies to faile from vs for euer, but holdeth our ſoules in life, and keepeth vs from the pit of deſtruction. Wherevpon, we read that as <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing had experience of Gods helpe, in his deliuerance out of the paw of the Lyon, and out of the paw of the Beare, afterwards feared not to encounter <hi>Goliah,</hi> but aſſured himſelfe that <hi>the Lord that had deliuered him out of the paw of the Lyon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37.</note> 
                     <hi>and out of the paw of the Beare, would alſo deliuer him out of the hand of that Philiſtim:</hi> ſo the children of God hauing once felt the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus in their ſoules, and the teſtimonie of the ſpirit witneſſing vnto their ſpirits that they were the ſonnes of God, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards feared not the encounters of ſinne or Satan, but aſſured themſelues, that nothing ſhould be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus. So wee ſee that our Apoſtle breaketh out and ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate vs from the loue of Chriſt?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.35.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or nakednes, or perill, or ſword? Nay I am perſwaded that neither death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">38.</note> 
                     <hi>nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">39.</note> 
                     <hi>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall bee able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord</hi> And againe, <hi>I know whom I haue beleeued, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keepe that which I haue committed vnto him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.</note> which is my ſelfe againſt that day. And thus many others of Gods children as vpon other grounds, ſo in aſſurance of Gods vnchangeable reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his doings, haue builded a full and aſſured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of their perſeuerance.</p>
                  <p>Now we muſt vnderſtand, that in perſeuerance there be two things, which ye may call the parts of it: the one is a holy will and deſire to perſeuere in that grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſtand: the other is a reall continuance, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:599:44"/> perſiſting in that grace wherein wee ſtand. This reall continuance and continuall perſiſting in the grace wherein we ſtand, is often in the beſt of Gods children ſo abated and diminiſhed, that it ſeemeth vtterly to bee extinguiſhed: but that holy will and deſire to perſeuere, the Lord doth neuer ſuffer vtterly to faile from his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren. Take for example the holy prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> did not <hi>Dauid</hi> in the bitternes of his ſoule cry, <hi>Will the Lord abſent himſelfe for euer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7.8.9. 88.14.15.16.</note> 
                     <hi>and will he be no more intreated? Is his mercy cleane gone for euer, and is his promiſe come vtterly to an end for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more? Hath God forgotten to be gracious, and will he ſhut vp his louing kindneſſe in diſpleaſure?</hi> And againe, <hi>Lord, why abhorreſt thou my ſoule, and hideſt thy face frome mee? Lord, where are thy old louing kindneſſes? thy terrors doe I ſuffer with a troubled minde thy wrathfull diſpleaſure goeth ouer me, and the feare of thee hath vndone mee.</hi> His reall continuance, ye ſee, ſeemeth to be cut off, and himſelfe to be ſeparated from the Lord; but by his gronings and cries it appeareth that his holy deſire ſtill remained. <hi>Pauls</hi> care likewiſe was interrupted, and his reall continuance remitted, when hee was ſo exalted through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of reuelations,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</note> that <hi>there was giuen vnto him a pricke in the fleſh, euen the meſſenger of Satan to buffet him:</hi> yet in that he then <hi>beſought the Lord thriſe that that meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan might depart from him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> it appeareth that this his holy deſire ſtill remained. And this holy deſire of perſeuering is it which the Lord accepteth, and then is he ſaid to giue vs this grace of perſeuerance, when hee giueth vs a perpetuall will and deſire, of perſeuering in that grace wherein wee ſtand, howſoeuer the very act of perſeuering by ſinne, tentation, or other trouble ſeeme to be cut off and quite failed ſometimes euen in the deareſt of Gods children.</p>
                  <p>Here then is a notable comfort for the broken and contrite heart, for the humbled and afflicted ſoule. For tell me, ô thou diſtreſſed ſoule, hath the ſpirit ſometimes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:599:45"/> witneſſed vnto thy ſpirit that thou waſt the childe of God? Hath the loue of God ſometimes beene ſo ſhed abroad in thine heart, that thou haſt verily perſwaded thy ſelfe of the loue of God towards thee? Haſt thou ſometimes beene delighted in the law of thy God, and felt the ſweet comforts of God in Chriſt Ieſus in thy ſoule? Why then is now thy ſoule ſo heauy, and why is it ſo diſquieted within thee? Why doe thoughts ariſe in thy heart, and why doth the ſleepe depart from thine eyes? O waite vpon the Lord, and put thy truſt in him; for hee that hath begun a good worke in thee, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it vntill the day of Chriſt Ieſus. He hath ſaid it by his holy Apoſtle, and ſhall he not doe it? The ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will not lie,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29.</note> nor repent; for <hi>he is not a man that he ſhould repent.</hi> He hath begun a good worke in thee, euen of his loue and his mercy towards thee, and as himſelfe, ſo his loue is vnchangeable, ſo that whom hee loueth once, he loueth vnto the end. O but therefore thou art troubled, becauſe he doth not ſeem to continue his louing kindnes towards thee. Thou feeleſt not that ioy in the Holy Ghoſt, that comfort in Gods loue which thou waſt wont to finde, thou art euen dead vnto the life of God. Well, did not <hi>Dauid</hi> cry out, <hi>Lord where are thy old louing kindneſſes, where are thy former mercies?</hi> Did he not pray, <hi>reſtore me to the ioy of thy ſaluation, and renue a right ſpirit within me.</hi> And againe, <hi>O quicken mee according to thy word, quicken me according to thy louing kindneſſe.</hi> So that thou ſeeſt there hath <hi>no tentation taken thee, but ſuch as appertaineth to man,</hi> euen ſuch as haue ouertaken men after Gods owne heart. But tell me, doth it not greeue thee that thou doeſt not feele that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that comfort, that ioy that thou waſt wont to finde in thy God through Ieſus Chriſt? Doeſt thou not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and long to feele that aſſurance, &amp; comfort, &amp; ioy that thou waſt wont to finde in thy ſoule? O yes, it is thy doubtings that trouble thee, and comfort which thou longeſt for. Well then good enough. It is <hi>a broken and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:599:45"/> contrite heart</hi> that greeueth at his ſinnes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17.</note> that greeueth at his wants, that the Lord loueth, and <hi>a troubled ſpirit,</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the cogitation of his ſlips and imperfections, is a ſacrifice acceptable vnto him. And againe, this holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of any grace is the grace it ſelfe. A deſire of comfort is a great part of comfort, and a deſire of perſeuering is a chiefe part of perſeuerance, and hee that deſireth any grace of God, tending to ſaluation ſhall ſurely haue it. For ſo Chriſt hath promiſed, ſaying, <hi>I will giue to him that is a thirſt of the well of the water of life freely:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.6.</note> which is the ſame with that in the Prophet, where it is ſaid, <hi>Ho, euery one that thirſteth, come yee to the waters,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1.</note> 
                     <hi>and yee that haue no ſiluer come, buy, and eat, come I ſay, buy wine and milke without ſiluer and without money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Comfort then your ſelues, be of good comfort in the Lord, all yee that thirſt after and deſire the things that belong vnto your peace. Let not your ſinnes, or your wants and imperfections too much caſt you downe or diſmay you. What if he will haue you to ſaile by hell to heauen? He that continueth this holy deſire in you, will not ſuffer his mercies vtterly to faile from you for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Heauineſſe may endure for a night, for a ſhort ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ioy commeth in the morning, after a while hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe is turned into ioy, and ſackcloth into the garment of gladnes. Where he hath begun he will make an end, and ſcattering this cloud he will ſhew vnto thee the light of his holy countenance. In the meane time, let that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire which is in thee, be a pledge of his loue vnto thee, and aſſure thy ſelfe, he ſhall fulfill all thy hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and reſtore thee to thy wonted ioyes againe.</p>

Hence then I obſerue that both the beginning and the perfiting of our obedience to the Goſpell, and indeed of euery good worke in vs, is only from God.

Haue wee then no good thing but which wee receiue from God? Doth not fleſh and blood reueale any myſterie of our ſaluation vnto vs?

If in vs there be any thing that is good, it is wholly the gift of God beſtowed on vs. Hee onely hath the intereſt both in the beginning, and in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it in vs. Which alſo yet farther appeareth by this, in that wee giue thankes vnto God for our calling into the fellowſhip which we haue in the Goſpell, and for all other his workes of mercie on vs, and in that wee praie vnto God for encreaſe in all knowledge and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for euery grace of his ſpirit which he knoweth to be needefull for vs. For whatſoeuer it is, wherefore we giue thankes vnto the Lord, thereby wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we haue reciued it from the Lord, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is wherefore wee pray vnto the Lord, thereby

Hee I ſay doth all things onely, not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by himſelfe, but by the miniſterie of his ſeruants. And albeit he, becauſe he worketh not by his ſpirit, but

Let not the Miniſter then, dare to aſſume vnto himſelfe that honor which onely belongeth vnto the Lord. This is his honor, that in the great worke of mans ſaluation he vſeth his miniſterie, and by him as his inſtrument worketh what he will.

                  <p n="3">3. Hence you may learne in what account and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard yee are to haue the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus. True and moſt true it is, as already yee haue heard, that God onely beginneth euery good worke in vs, and likewiſe confirmeth, and ſtrengthneth vs, and maketh vs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound therein more and more. But he doth it, as alſo yee haue heard, by their miniſterie whom he hath ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for the gathering together of the Saints, and for the edification of the body of Chriſt. Ye are therefore ſo to thinke of vs, as of the miniſters of Chriſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the ſecrets of God, by whom he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to open your eyes, that yee may turne from darknes to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God, that ye may receiue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them which are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, by whom he hath appointed to reueale his will vnto you, and to fill you with the graces of his holy ſpirit, and by whom he hath appointed to bring to paſſe all the good pleaſure of his will in you. And if any man thinke not thus of vs, it is becauſe he knoweth vs not, neither him that hath ſent vs, nor what great works the Lord work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, what great mercies the Lord ſheweth vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                  <p>The third thing which here I note is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that he was perſwaded that he that had begun this good worke of embracing the goſpel in them, would performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt; or as he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8.</note> 
                     <hi>would confirme them in it vnto the end, that they might be blameleſſe in the day of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Whence two doubts may be moued not vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the anſwering. The one is, how one man may bee perſwaded of another mans perſeuerance or ſaluation, what a kinde of perſwaſion it is which is of anothers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance or ſaluation. The other is, whether the Lord performed this worke of the <hi>Philippians</hi> continuance in the fellowſhip which they had in the goſpell, vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle was perſwaded hee would. To ſpeake firſt vnto this latter, moſt lamentable it is, but moſt true it is, that in thoſe places where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the name of the Lord was called vpon, and the goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus freely and ſincerely preached, not onely at <hi>Philippi</hi> but in many other Churches which the Apoſtles had planted in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and elſe where, there now through the ſecret, but iuſt iudgement of God, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Turciſme, and abominable paganiſme hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion, and holdeth it at his will. But as we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this place of the Apoſtle, ſo we are to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the doubt; for if wee vnderſtand the Apoſtles perſwaſion to be touching the Church that then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was at <hi>Philippi,</hi> that the Lord would continue them in the fellowſhip of the goſpell vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt, .i. vntill their death, when they ſhould be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into his kingdome of glory, I take it that it may very well be preſumed, and ſafely auerred that the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:599:50"/> this worke of the <hi>Philippians</hi> continuance in the fellowſhip, which they had in the goſpell vntill the day of Chriſt Ieſus, as the Apoſtle was perſwaded he would: for ſuch was their loue and liberalitie towards the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and ſuch their conſtant abiding in the truth from the firſt day vntill then, that as the Apoſtle thereupon was perſwaded, that the Lord would confirme them in that grace wherein they ſtood vnto their end, ſo wee therevpon may perſwade our ſelues that the Lord did confirme them therein vnto the end. But if we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Apoſtles perſwaſion to be touching the Church ſucceſſiuely at <hi>Philippi,</hi> that the Lord would continue that Church in all ages, in the fellowſhip of the goſpell vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt, .i. vntill his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to iudgement, then may it ſeeme that the Apoſtle failed in his perſwaſion, becauſe of their ſubiection now a long time vnto the Turke. But euen here alſo it may be ſaid, that as when the Apoſtle wrote, the <hi>Philippians ſhined as lights in the middeſt of a naughty and crooked nation,</hi> ſo now alſo in that helliſh thraldome vnto the Turke, the Lord hath a Church there, though not ſo eminent as ſometimes it was, yet a Church. For as at the firſt, the Apoſtles were ſent as ſheepe in the middeſt of wolues, and as it may be hoped that Chriſt hath his Church euen in the middeſt of Romiſh Egypt; ſo may it alſo be hoped, that hee hath his Church in that heatheniſh ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of the Turke, and euen in the Citie of <hi>Philippi.</hi> But I now rather approue the former anſwer, as better agreeing with the circumſtances of this ſcripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſeemeth that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of them that then were at <hi>Philippi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for anſwer vnto the ſecond doubt, which is how one man may be perſwaded of another mans perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ſaluation, wee muſt vnderſtand that there is a threefold perſwaſion. One grounded vpon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the ſpirit, vnto our ſpirit, whereby we doe moſt certainely perſwade our ſelues of whatſoeuer grace is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:599:50"/> ſealed vnto vs by the earneſt of the ſpirit. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion is moſt certaine, but this perſwaſion we cannot haue of any other, but onely of our ſelues, foraſmuch as this ariſeth of the teſtimonie of the ſpirit vnto our ſpirit. Another perſwaſion there is grounded vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant immutabilitie of God in his doings, whereby wee certainely perſwade our ſelues, that whatſoeuer good worke God hath begun in vs, he will confirme it vnto the end. And a third perſwaſion there is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on charitie, whereby wee perſwade our ſelues of grace, where we ſee obedience to the goſpell, conſtant abiding in the truth, patience in troubles, loue of the brethren, and the like. Now one man cannot be perſwaded of an other mans perſeuerance or ſaluation, by the firſt kinde of perſwaſion grounded vpon the teſtimonie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, becauſe no man knoweth what the ſpirit witneſſeth vnto anothers ſpirit, but onely to his owne. But both by the ſecond kinde of perſwaſion grounded vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of the Lord, and likewiſe by the third grounded vpon charitie, one man may be perſwaded of another mans perſeuerance or ſaluation. By the firſt kinde of perſwaſion the Apoſtle was perſwaded of his owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, when he ſaid, <hi>I am perſwaded that neither death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.38.</note> 
                     <hi>nor life, nor Angels </hi> and ſo euery one of vs vpon the like ground, may perſwade our ſelues of our owne perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance and ſaluation. By the ſecond and third kindes of perſwaſion, the Apoſtle was perſwaded of the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> perſeuerance and ſaluation, as in this place we ſee; and ſo euery one of vs vpon the like grounds, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded one of anothers perſeuerance and ſaluation. The firſt neuer faileth, becauſe the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit whereon it is grounded is euer true. The ſecond like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neuer faileth, becauſe Gods purpoſes are euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and with him is no variablenes, neither ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing by turning The third hath a wonderfull great probability, but may faile, becauſe it leaneth on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fruits of the ſpirit in man, whoſe heart none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:599:51"/> but he that ſearcheth it. The firſt is not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: the ſecond is mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 6: and the third hath his ground <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. For a full anſwer then vnto the ſecond doubt, we ſay that one man may be perſwaded of another mans perſeuerance and ſaluation, both by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third kinds of perſwaſion, and farther that of whoſe perſeuerance and ſaluation we are perſwaded by the third kinde of perſwaſion, of his perſeuerance and ſaluation alſo we are to be perſwaded by the ſecond kind of perſwaſion, .i. of whoſe perſeuerance and ſaluation, we may conceiue a good perſwaſion by the fruits of the ſpirit in them, of them we are certainely to be perſwaded that God will neuer leaue them, or forſake them, but confirme them vnto the end. And thus I reſolue vpon the reaſon which the Apoſtle ſetteth downe of his per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwaſion, grounded on the conſtant immutabilitie of God in his doings: for what ſaith the Apoſtle? <hi>As it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth me</hi> ſaith he <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It becommeth mee, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſo to iudge of you, euen to be perſwaded that hee that hath begun this worke in you &amp;c. And why did it become him ſo to iudge, ſo to be perſwaded? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I haue you in remembrance,</hi> becauſe I gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this of you, <hi>that both in my bands &amp;c.</hi> .i. that whether I were bound for the goſpell, or defended the goſpell at <hi>Nero</hi> his barre, or confirmed the goſpell by my ſufferings, you all were partakers of my grace, and were in a ſort with me in my bands, and in my defence, and confirmation of the goſpell. I know there are great diuerſities of interpretations of this text of ſcripture; but iudging this to be moſt ſimple, I will not trouble you with any other. The reaſon then of that his perſwaſion of them was this, becauſe ſuch was the <hi>Philippians</hi> zeale for the goſpell, and loue of him, that howſoeuer it were with him, whether he were bound for the goſpell, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the goſpell, or confirmed the goſpell, they ſtucke cloſe vnto him, and tooke part with him both in his bands, &amp; in his defence, &amp; confirmation of the goſpell.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:599:51"/>
                  <p>The firſt thing then which here I note is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that it became him ſo to iudge of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> ſo to be perſwaded of them as he ſaid <hi>verſ</hi> 6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their zeale for the goſpell, and loue of him. Whence I obſerue, that it becommeth vs certainely, to be perſwaded of their perſeuerance and ſaluation, and that they are the children of God, in whom we ſee obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the goſpell, zeale for the truth, loue of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, true ſignes of godlineſſe, euident fruits of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. That in charitie we are euery man to hope the beſt one of another, the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth, when hee ſaith, that <hi>Charitie beleeueth all things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.</note> 
                     <hi>charitie hopeth all things.</hi> Charitie beleeueth all things, therefore in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie we are not to ſuſpect the worſt, but to beleeue the beſt one of another. Charitie hopeth all things, therefore in charitie we are not to miſtruſt the worſt, but to hope the beſt one of another. Neither onely ſo, when there are ſuch outward tokens of grace and godlineſſe, as ought eaſily to cauſe vs to beleeue and hope the beſt one of an other; but ſo alſo when there are not ſo plaine tokens of grace, ſo manifeſt fruits of the ſpirit. Nay when there are manifeſt tokens of want of grace, fearefull tokens of being giuen vp into a reprobate minde, yet are wee not to deſpaire of ſuch a one, but to leaue him vnto the Lord vnto whom he ſtandeth or falleth. Witnes the Apoſtle, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Who art thou that condemneſt another mans ſeruant? he ſtandeth or falleth to his owne maſter.</hi> There hope the beſt we cannot, and yet condemne him or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of him we may not. Now as in charitie we may not deſpaire of any, but hope well where all is not well, and perſwade our ſelues the beſt where we ſee the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tokens of the ſpirit: ſo where we haue iuſt cauſe of this perſwaſion by the true fruits of righteouſnes, we are certainely to be perſwaded that they are the children of God. Which as it appeareth by this place of our Apoſtle, ſo alſo by that, where he ſaith of the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that <hi>he knew that they were the elect of God,</hi>

                  <p>A good leſſon for many of vs to learne: for ſo crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ill affected are we commonly one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that we will eaſily perſwade our ſelues the worſt one of another, but ſeldome perſwade our ſelues the beſt one of another. Though we ſee many great tokens of Gods graces in our brethren, if we ſee any infirmitie or offence in them, we grate vpon that, and we could be well perſwaded of them but for that; which if it might haue ſtopped the Apoſtles perſwaſion of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he ſhould neuer haue beene ſo well perſwaded of them as he was: for among them there were murmurings and reaſonings, and many things done through contention and vaine-glory; yet looking vpon their obedience to the goſpell, their conſtant abiding in the truth, their chriſtian loue of him, he perſwadeth himſelfe the beſt of them, euen <hi>that he that hath begun &amp;c.</hi> So beloued, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we ſee ſlips and infirmities in our brethren, yea though ſometimes we ſee them fall flat to the ground, yet if we ſee the manifeſt tokens of Gods graces in them, let vs perſwade our ſelues the beſt of them, yea let vs perſwade our ſelues of them as of our ſelues, that they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:599:52"/> are the children of God, and that their ſaluation is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſealed in the heauens: for ſo it becommeth vs to iudge of them after the example of our Apoſtle, becauſe of the fruits of the ſpirit in them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond thing which here I note, is the teſtimonie which the Apoſtle giues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Philippians</hi> of their zeale for the goſpell, of their loue of him, and of their growth in godlineſſe, through the effectuall preaching of the goſpell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, in that he ſaith, <hi>that both in his bands, and in his defence, and confirmation of the goſpell they all were partakers of his grace.</hi> This was a ſure token that they had well profited in the ſchoole of Chriſt, in that whether the Apoſtle were bound for the goſpell, or defended the goſpell, or confirmed the goſpell, ſtill they ſtucke cloſe to him, and tooke part with him, and were, though they were abſent from him, yet in zeale and in an holy affection, in ſome ſort in bands with him, and in defence and confirmation of the goſpell with him. Hence then I obſerue a notable argument how we may haue proofe vnto our ſelues, and giue alſo proofe vnto others of our zeale for the goſpell, of our loue of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:599:53"/> Miniſters of the goſpell, by whom we haue been taught in the word, of the power of the word in our hearts and ſoules, and of our growth in godlines through the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word. Is there any perſecution of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Ieſus Chriſt by any cruell tyrants, Pope, Turke, or Spaniard, or any other? Are your Miniſters and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers attached, and brought before any bloudy inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the goſpels ſake of Chriſt Ieſus? Are they brought vnto the barre there, as felons or traitors to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that truth, which in all ſimplicitie and ſinceritie they haue taught amongſt you? Are they beaten and ſcourged, and caſt into priſon, and bound with bands, and their feete made faſt in the ſtocks for the defence of the goſpell? Are they brought to the fire and fagot, to the rope and hatchet, to Lyons and wilde beaſts by their bloud to confirme the goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus? Such times and tyrannies, beloued, our forefathers haue ſeene, and it may be that ſome of you haue ſeene them: but ô Lord, let neuer our eyes ſee ſuch times and tyrannies againe, neither let our ſeede ſee them, nor our ſeedes ſeede from henceforth for euer. But put caſe it were thus as hath beene ſaid. Doe yee thinke yee ſhould ſtand cloſe to the truth in ſuch time of trouble, and not ſtart aſide like a broken bow? Could yee finde in your hearts to vndergo with your Miniſters and Teachers, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe cruelty of any bloudy inquiſition? to ſtand with them at the barre in defence of that truth, which they haue taught you? To be tried with them by mockings and ſcourgings, by bonds and impriſonment? to goe to fire and fagot with them, and with your bloud to ſeale that truth which they haue taught you? Here were zeale for the goſpell in deed, here were loue of your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, here were a proofe of the power of the word in you, here were an argument of the effectuall preaching of the goſpell vnto you. And ſuch proofes and arguments, many in the primitiue Church both had vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and gaue vnto others, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:599:53"/> the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 37, 38.</note> that <hi>ſome were racked and would not be deliuered, that they might receiue a better reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> others were tried <hi>by mockings and ſcourgings, yea moreouer by bands and impriſonment; others were ſtoned &amp;c.</hi> So powerfully had the word wrought vpon them, that nothing could daunt them, but through perſecution, and anguiſh, and tribulation, and famine, and nakednes, and perill, and ſword, and all they went.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but you will ſay, there was no ſuch matter with the <hi>Philippians,</hi> whoſe example I vrge, they gaue no ſuch proofe of their zeale, or loue, or growth in godlines tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the preaching of the goſpell, as now we ſpeake of. Well then, could yee willingly be partakers with your Miniſters and Teachers in their bands, and in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and confirmation of the goſpell in ſuch ſort as the <hi>Philippians</hi> were with <hi>Paul?</hi> Would yee not be aſhamed of their chaines? Would yee communicate to their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſupply that which they lacked? Would yee be carefull, that ſome might miniſter vnto them ſuch things as they wanted? Would their bands ſo affect you as if yee were bound with them? Would yee count their ſufferings for the defence and confirmation of the goſpell, as common to you with them? Would yee in heart &amp; ſoule be ioyned vnto them, both in their bands, and in their defence, and confirmation of the goſpell? This alſo ſhould be a notable proof both vnto your ſelues, and others of your holy zeale for the truth, of your godly increaſe in all ſpirituall vnderſtanding through the word, and of the effectuall power of the ſpirit in you, through the miniſterie of the word. Such a proofe <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> had vnto himſelfe, and gaue vnto others, as appeareth by that teſtimonie which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle giueth to him, when he ſaith, that <hi>he often refreſhed him, and was not aſhamed of his chaine;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>that at Rome hee ſought him very diligently, and found him; and that in many things he miniſtred vnto him at Epheſus.</hi> Not once, but often he refreſhed him, he ſhunned him not, nor was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:599:54"/> aſhamed of him becauſe of his bands, but comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and vnderſtanding that <hi>Nero</hi> had caſt him into priſon, hee ſought him very diligently, and would not reſt till he had found him, and before at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> hee had in bountifull ſort cared for him. Here the word had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken roote downeward, and brought forth fruit vpward, and powerfully wrought on him. And ſo the bleſſing that followed hervpon.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18.</note> The Apoſt. prayed for him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the Lord grant vnto him that he may find mercy with the Lord at that day;</hi> nor for him onely, but for his whole houſe,<note place="margin">16.</note> ſaying, <hi>The Lord giue mercie vnto the houſe of One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphorus;</hi> and in that the Apoſtle prayed for him and for his houſe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6.</note> it was in effect a promiſe of bleſſing and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vnto him and to his houſe. The like teſtimonie the Apoſtle giueth vnto the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> where hee ſaith, that <hi>they receaued the word in much affliction, with ioy of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> When there was much affliction, when there was great tribulation and perſecution, becauſe of the word, yet they receiued the word willingly and ioyfully. Which the Apoſtle, bringeth as a plaine proofe vnto them of their ſpirituall coniunction with Chriſt, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection vnto life. So that when the word hath wrought thus vpon vs, that in much affliction wee can delight in it, that wee gladly cheriſh and refreſh them that ſuffer trouble, euen vnto bands for the Goſpels ſake, that we are ſo affected therewith, as if we alſo were in bands with them, that we count their ſufferings for the defence and confirmation of the Goſpell, our ſufferings, it is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument that the word hath had great power in vs, and that we haue well profited in the Schoole of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But, if many in theſe our daies ſhould examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by this rule of what power the word is in them, and vnto what growth in godlyneſſe they are come, it is to be feared that their triall would not be much to their comfort. Our bleſſed Sauiour expounding the parable of the Sower, ſaith, <hi>That he that receaued ſeed in the ſtonie ground, is he which heareth the word, and incontinently with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:599:54"/> ioy receiueth it: Yet hath he no roote in himſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 13 12.</note> 
                     <hi>and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth but a ſeaſon: for as ſoone as tribulation or perſecution commeth becauſe of the word, by and by hee is offended.</hi> And our Apoſtle complained,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.</note> that at his firſt anſwering no man aſſiſted him, but all forſooke him. Not to ſpeake of thoſe which refuſe to hearken to inſtruction, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelues in our aſſemblies, is not much ſeede now ſowen in ſtonie ground, if tribulation and perſecution ſhould come, becauſe of the word, would not many of vs be offended, and rather turne, as they ſay, then burne? If our <hi>Paules</hi> and Preachers ſhould bee brought to their anſwere in the defence of the Goſpell, would they bee much aſſiſted, or would they not be vtterly forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Yes, beloued, a great many of vs that now giue them reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable good countenance, would bee aſhamed of their chaines: a great many of vs that now heare them pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, would feare or diſdaine to looke on them in their trouble. We think our ſelues now reaſonable good fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Word, and of the Miniſters thereof, if we be not enemies vnto them. But if we come vnto them, and countenance them, then wee thinke our ſelues very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward indeede, and that the word hath much preuailed with vs. And it were to be wiſhed, that the number of ſuch were farre greater then it is. But if a tempeſt ſhould ariſe, ſo that our ſhip ſhould bee couered with waues, would not a great many of vs wiſh our ſelues out of that ſhip wherein we ſaile, and in another that ſailed in a more calme ſea? If our Miniſters &amp; teachers ſhould be carried vnto the Guild-hal, there to anſwer in the defence of the goſpell, would we not as Chriſt his Diſciples did forſake them &amp; flie; &amp; as <hi>Peter</hi> did forſweare them? Here would be indeed a triall of the power of the word in vs. And how we would ſtand in this triall, may in part be conie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctured by ſome preſent experience. For where the word &amp; the Miniſters therof are fauoured, if the painful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be poore and bare, becauſe of his ſmall portion and and maintenance, how many of vs will yeeld vp our
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:599:55"/> impropriations vnto him, which properly belonge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? Or, if wee haue no ſuch, how many of vs will yeeld vp vnto him our couenant with him for our tithes? Or, if wee haue no ſuch, how many of vs will take care that by our defrauding him of any due, he be not poore or bare? Or, if we be not guiltie herein, how many of vs will ioyne our heads &amp; our purſes together to encreaſe his maintenance for his encouragement, &amp; bettering of his eſtate? Likewiſe, if ſome popiſhly or naughtily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, bring him vniuſtly into trouble, how many of vs will aſſiſt him? how many of vs will goe to the high Commiſſion with him? how many of vs will doe our whole endeauour for him? how many of vs will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vnto his charges in ſuch trouble? Doe wee faile in theſe leſſe things, and would wee hold in greater things? Will we not part with ſome of our liuing to him, and would we hazard our life with him? Will wee not now aſſiſt him, and communicate to his charges in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and would we then cleaue cloſe vnto him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to his affliction? I leaue it vnto euery man to thinke of it. For concluſion of this note, we ſee how wee may haue proofe vnto our ſelues, and giue proofe vnto others of our zeale for the Goſpell, of our loue of the Miniſters of the Goſpell, of the power of the word in vs, and of our growth in godlineſſe through the preaching of the word. Let vs therefore willingly and gladly take part, if neede be, with our miniſters and teachers in their bands, and in their defence and confirmation of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; and in the meane time let vs giue them what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encouragement, what helpe and aſſiſtance we can, that ſo the power of the word in vs, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting thereby, may be teſtified both vnto our ſelues and to others.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which here I note, is that the Apoſtle ſaith that all the <hi>Philipp.</hi> were pertakers of his grace, both in his bands, &amp;c. They onely relieued him, &amp; refreſhed him, and were carefull for him being in bands, and were
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:599:55"/> in their ſoules and affections knit vnto him, both in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ands, and in his defence and confirmation of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and for this cauſe he ſaith, <hi>they were pertakers of his grace in his bands, &amp;c.</hi> Whence I obſerue a good note of ſuch as are ioyned in the communion of Saints, and that is this, howſoeuer they abound in the meaſure of grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others, yet in the grace they preferre not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before others. So we ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> writeth to them that had obtained like precious faith with him, ſaying, <hi>Simon Peter a ſeruant and an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.</note> 
                     <hi>to you which haue obtained like precious faith with vs, &amp;c.</hi> In the meaſure of faith no doubt he excelled all them to whom he wrote, yet in the grace it ſelfe of faith, ye ſee, he equalled them vnto himſelfe. So wee ſee the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> ſaith vnto them, <hi>Holy brethren,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.1.</note> 
                     <hi>pertakers of the heauenly calling, &amp;c.</hi> In meaſure of gifts by the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calling, no doubt, he was farre before them to whom he wrote, yet touching the grace it ſelfe, he counteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pertakers with him of the heauenly vocation. And ſo our Apoſtle in the meaſure of ſufferings, excelled not not the <hi>Philippians</hi> onely, but all others, yet in the grace it ſelfe he ſaith, that <hi>they were pertakers of his grace both in his bands, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the bleſſing of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, that they which are ioyned in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fellowſhip, willingly equall themſelues vnto them that are of meaner gifts, and doe not ſtand vpon their prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, either in bleſſings or in ſufferings, but as they that haue one God, and one Lord, and one Baptiſme, and one hope of their calling, ſo they eſteeme of others graces as of their owne.</p>
                  <p>Which may ſerue for a bridle vnto ſuch ouerweaning ſpirits, as too haſtily and ſharpely cenſure them that come ſhort of themſelues in the meaſure either of other bleſſings, or of ſufferings. For, to ſpeake onely of the latter ſort, are not there ſome that ſo brag of their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, that if others of their brethren come ſomewhat ſhort of them, they condemne them for white-liuered
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:599:56"/> ſouldiers, and faint-hearted brethren? And tell them that you were affected with their ſufferings, as if ye had ſuffered with them, that yee were not vnmindfull of them, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated vnto their afflictions, will they count you partakers of their grace in their bands? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they not tell you, that this is but cold charity in regard of that zealous courage w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhould be in you, &amp; that this is nothing in compariſon of their ſufferings? So vaine a thing is man, as to eſteeme beſt of other his owne graces, ſo moſt of his owne ſufferings, and ſo to ſtand vpon his owne meaſure of grace, that he makes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reckoning of the ſame grace in meaner meaſure in others of his brethren. But we ſee the practiſe both of our Apoſtle, and of other of the Apoſtles, which may ſerue for our inſtruction in this point. Let vs therefore after their example, howſoeuer we abound in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of any grace, make reckoning of them in whom that grace is, as partakers of the ſame grace with vs: for it is the ſame ſpirit that giueth the ſame grace both vnto vs and others, and the ſame ſpirit diſtributeth to euery man ſeuerally the meaſure of grace as he will. Let vs not therefore for our meaſure of grace whatſoeuer it be, be it in wiſdome, learning, patience, ſuffering, or any other, exalt our ſelues aboue our brethren, but let vs make much of the grace of the ſpirit in them, and let vs reioyce ouer them, as hauing obteined the like precious grace with vs.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle calleth his bands for the defence and confirmation of the Goſpell, a grace: for ſo we vnderſtand that they were partakers of his grace, in that they were partakers of his bands for the defence and confirmation &amp;c. Whence I obſerue, that to ſuffer bands, impriſonment, perſecution, and the like, for the Goſpels ſake, is a ſpeciall grace and gift of God. So the Apoſtle againe in the latter end of this chapter affirmeth, ſaying, <hi>Vnto you it is giuen for Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29.</note> 
                     <hi>that not onely yee ſhould beleeue in him, but alſo ſuffer
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:599:56"/> for his ſake.</hi> Whence it is plaine, that as faith in Chriſt Ieſus, ſo to ſuffer for his ſake is a ſpeciall gift of God. And herevpon the Apoſtles reioyced when they were beaten,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41.</note> that <hi>they were counted worthy to ſuffer rebuke for Chriſt his name.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> And our Apoſtle reioyced aſmuch in his ſufferings as in any thing. And why, but becauſe they counted their ſufferings as ſpeciall gifts and graces vpon them?</p>
                  <p>Where yet firſt we muſt note, that ſimply to ſuffer bands and impriſonment, perſecution and trouble is no grace or gift of God, but to ſuffer theſe things for Chriſt his ſake, for the Goſpels ſake, for righteouſnes ſake. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let no man ſuffer as a murtherer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15,</note> 
                     <hi>or as a theefe, or as an euill doer, or as a buſie-body in other mens matters: But if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">16.</note> .i. for Chriſt his ſake and the goſpels, <hi>let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalfe.</hi> Secondly, that to ſuffer bands and perſecution for Chriſt his ſake and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, is no grace or gift of God in it ſelfe, and in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, but onely by way of conſequent: for if to ſuffer bands or affliction for the goſpels ſake were in it ſelfe, and in the nature of the thing a grace and gift of God, then were we to pray for affliction and trouble for the Goſpels ſake, as we doe for other graces of the ſpirit. But now no man doth pray to be tried and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to be perſecuted and impriſoned for the Goſpells ſake; neither is any man ſo to pray, becauſe this were in deede to tempt God. But our praier is for ſtrength, and patience, and helpe in trouble, whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe the Lord by troubles for the Goſpels ſake to try vs, as the praiers of the godly at all times doe ſhew. To ſuffer bands then and trouble for the Goſpels ſake, is no grace of God in it ſelfe, but onely in euent and by conſequent. For what is the euent, fruit, and conſequent of ſuffering for the Goſpels ſake? Firſt in reſpect of our ſelues, it bringeth forth the fruits of patience, experience, and hope, as it is written, <hi>We reioyce in tribulation, knowing that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:599:57"/> tribulation bringeth forth patience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

And againe in reſpect of the Church, by the ſufferings of the Saints for the Goſpell, many children are ſtrengthned, and many begotten vnto the Church, as it is written in this chapter afterward, <hi>Many of the brethren in the Lord are boldened through my bands,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.14.</note> 
                     <hi>and dare more frankly ſpeake the word.</hi> To which purpoſe alſo it is ſaid, that <hi>the blood of the Martirs is the ſeede of the Church.</hi> Becauſe then of the grace which followeth our bands and troubles for the Goſpels ſake, both in reſpect of God, and of his Church, and of our ſelues, therefore it is that they are called a grace and gift of God. So that to ſuffer bands and troubles for Chriſt his ſake, and the Goſpels, is a grace and gift of God, nor in the nature of the thing, but becauſe of the grace giuen vs conſtantly and patiently to endure thoſe troubles, and becauſe of the grace which iſſueth thence for the good of our ſelues, for the glory of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:599:57"/> God, and for the benefit of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Yea but if to ſuffer bands, and affliction, and trouble for Chriſt his ſake and the Goſpels were a grace and gift of God any way, why ſhould the children of God be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo much perplexed thereat as they are? why ſhould they not alwaies be more welcome vnto them then they are? For anſwer whereunto we muſt vnderſtand, that in the children of God there is the fleſh and the ſpirit, an outward man, and an inward man. Are then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God often perplexed at their bands and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for Chriſt his ſake, and the Goſpels? It may be in their fleſh and outward man, but in their ſpirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man they are alwaies welcome vnto them; as our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>though our outward man periſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16.</note> and euen ſinke vnder the burthen of our afflictions, <hi>yet the inward man is renued daily,</hi> and made ſtronger and ſtronger through afflictions. And ſo we muſt vnderſtand all the places of ſcripture where the Saints ſeeme to faint vnder their afflictions. <hi>Dauid</hi> in his <hi>Pſalmes</hi> often complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of his troubles, no doubt becauſe they were heauy vnto his outward man: but vnto his inward man they were ſo welcome, that he ſaith,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>It is good for me that I haue beene afflicted, that I may learne thy ſtatutes:</hi> and againe, <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">67.</note> 
                     <hi>but now I keepe thy word.</hi> So our Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>he was preſſed out of meaſure paſſing ſtrength through affliction,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8.</note> ſo that his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man no doubt was not able to ſuſteine them; yet in his inward man he reioyced in them, and boaſted of them, and fainted not vnder them. So our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himſelfe ſaith,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>My ſoule is very heauy euen vnto the death,</hi> ſo that by his owne will he would haue had that cup to paſſe from him: but knowing his Fathers will immediatly he addeth, <hi>neuertheles not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> So that howſoeuer by our owne wills we would auoide bands and troubles for the goſpels ſake, as heauy and greeuous vnto our outward man, yet as our wills are ſanctified by Gods ſpirit and conformed vnto Gods
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:599:58"/> will, ſo they are welcome vnto vs, and acknowledged by vs to be a grace of God, giuen vnto his children for their good, and his glory.</p>
                  <p>Here then is a notable comfort, for all ſuch of Gods children as ſuffer bands and affliction for Chriſt his ſake and the goſpels. For what are their bands? They are the grace of God; and in ſuffering bands for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and confirmation of the Goſpell, they are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with the Saints of their grace. And as here they are called <hi>the grace of God,</hi> ſo elſewhere they are called <hi>the marks of the Lord Ieſus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.17.</note> Now may it not be a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto vs, to beare in our bodies <hi>the marks of the Lord Ieſus?</hi> Yet generally wee auoide bands and affliction, nay we murmure at them, nay we mocke at them, and hold them for ſimple men, that will not rather turne then burne, that will not rather renounce the truth, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch ſufferings for the truth. But tell me, ſhould not he be iudged fooliſh and ignorant, that ſhould auoid the gift of any grace? Should he not be thought ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that ſhould murmure or ſcorne to be marked with the marks of the Lord Ieſus? And how then ſhall wee thinke of him, that refuſeth or murmureth at bands and afflictions for Chriſt his ſake, or that maketh a mocke at them which doe ſuffer afflictions for Chriſt his ſake, which are the grace of God, and the marks of the Lord Ieſus? Beloued, we know not what bands and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bide vs for the Goſpels ſake. Surely for our ſinnes we haue deſerued to be deliuered vp into the will of our enemies, that they that hate vs euen with a perfit hatred ſhould rule ouer vs. And if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to deale with vs according to our deſeruings, yet let this be our comfort, that in our bands for the defence and confirmation of the Goſpell, we are partakers with many of the Saints of their grace, and that the life of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is made manifeſt as by moſt plaine tokens, in our bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10.</note> when we beare about in our bodies the dying of the Lord Ieſus. And in the meane time let vs giue all dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:599:58"/> that the word of Chriſt may dwell in vs plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that the effectuall power thereof may be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in vs, through our patient and conſtant ſuffering for Chriſt his ſake and the Goſpels, if the will of the Lord be ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the Apoſtles earneſt proteſtation of his loue towards the <hi>Philippians,</hi> which was the third thing which I noted in this ſecond branch of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>exordium,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>For God is my record &amp;c.</hi> that ſo, they might the rather both aſſure themſelues that ſuch was his perſwaſion of them, as hath beene ſaid, and likewiſe the more willingly hearken vnto the things that hee wrote vnto them. In the words I note a vehement proteſtation, and the thing whereof he maketh ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. His proteſtation is a calling of God to witnes that hee lieth not in this that now ſpeaketh, in theſe words, <hi>For God is my record.</hi> The thing whereof he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſuch proteſtation is of his hearty loue of them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God is my record how I long after you all,</hi> .i. with what a longing deſire to ſee you, I loue you all from the very heart roote,<note place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow then, the firſt thing which here I note, is the Apoſtles vehement proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not concerning any triuiall and ordinarie matter, but touching his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and feruent loue of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> nor to ſmall or no purpoſe, but to winne their attention vnto the word of their ſaluation more gladly. For he proteſteth &amp; ſweareth, an oath being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a calling of God to witneſſe of that wee ſpeake, for their aſſurance to whom wee ſweare, which whole definition is in this proteſtation; hee proteſteth ſayeth, and ſweareth vnto the <hi>Philipp.</hi> that he longeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them all, and greatly loueth them all from the very heart roote in Ieſus Chriſt, that ſo being perſwaded of his loue, they might giue the better heed vnto the things he wrote. Whence I obſerue that a proteſtation, or an oath by God, when the glory of God, or the good of our neighbour doth require it, may very lawfully bee made. And this is proued, firſt from the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of an oath. For, what is an oath? It is, as euen now we heard, an holy and religious calling of God to witnes, of the truth of that we ſpeake, for their aſſurance vnto whom we ſpeake; as here the Apoſtle for the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> aſſurance of his ſincere loue of them, calleth God to witnes how he longeth after them all, how greatly he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:599:59"/> loueth them all from the very heart root in Ieſus Chriſt. And what herein is vnbeſeeming a Chriſtian, or which may not lawfully be done? Secondly, it is proued from the expreſſe commaundement of God, for thus hath God commanded, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 6 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, and ſerue him, and ſhalt ſweare by his name.</hi> In which words, as to feare the Lord God, and to ſerue him, ſo to ſweare by his name is commanded. Thirdly, it is proued from the end of an oath, for the end of an oath is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide debates, &amp; to make an end of ſtrifes; as the Apoſtle ſheweth, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16.</note> that <hi>an oath for confirmation is among men an end of all ſtrife.</hi> And as <hi>Moſes</hi> in a plaine caſe ſheweth, ſaying, <hi>If a man deliuer to his neighbor to keepe Aſſe, or Oxe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exo.</hi> 22.10.11.</note> 
                     <hi>or Sheepe, or any beast, and it die, or be hurt, or taken away by enemies, and no man ſee it, an oath of the Lord ſhall bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them twaine, that hee hath not put his hand vnto his neighbours good, and the owner thereof ſhall take the oath, and he ſhall not make it good.</hi> And this being the end of an oath, why may it not lawfully be made? Fourthly, it is proued from the practiſe of holy men of God; for <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we reade, ſwore vnto <hi>Abimelech</hi> by God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.23. 26.31. 31.53.</note> that hee would not hurt him, nor his children, nor his childrens children: And <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſware one to another, to the like purpoſe: And ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> ſware one to another, to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Likewiſe our Apoſtle oftentimes in his Epiſtle proteſteth, and calleth God to witneſſe of that he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. &amp; 12.19. And God himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13.</note> becauſe hee had no greater to ſweare by, ſware by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as it is ſaid in the Prophet, and as the Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth. Laſtly, it is proued from a neceſſary conſequent, for if an oath be a part of Gods worſhip, will it not then neceſſarily follow, that an oath may lawfully be made? Now that an oath is a part of Gods worſhip, appeareth by many places of holy Scripture; as,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſ.</hi> 19.18.</note> where it is ſaid in the Prophet, <hi>In that day ſhall fiue Cities in the land of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt ſpeake the language of Canaan, and ſhall ſweare by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:599:60"/> Lord of hoſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.2.</note> that is, ſhall renounce their ſuperſtitions, and ſerue God as he hath appoynted. And againe, where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſweare the Lord liueth in truth, in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in righteouſnes.</hi> And therefore the Lord by that Prophet,<note place="margin">5.7.</note> in the next Chapter complaineth of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that they had forſaken him: and how did that appeare? becauſe they ſwore by them that were no Gods: <hi>Thy children,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>haue forſaken mee, and ſworne hy them that are no Gods.</hi> So that to ſweare by them that are no Gods, is to forſake God. And why? becauſe it is to giue his worſhip to another, euen to them that are no Gods: which, who ſo doth, he forſaketh God.</p>
                  <p>O, but will the godly ſoule ſay, this needed not in ſuch a ſwearing age, to proue the lawfulnes of ſwearing; and will the curſed ſwearer ſay, this is well indeed, that I haue ſo good allowance for my ſwearing from the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. Hearken therefore yet a while, and know how we may proteſt and ſweare lawfully. Firſt therefore, if wee will ſweare lawfully, we muſt ſweare by the name of God. For both the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement &amp; practiſe are ſo, as already we haue heard, &amp; the reaſon therof is very plain: for who can witneſſe, that he that ſweareth lyeth not, but God onely that beholdeth the heart, and knoweth what is in man? Or who is omnipotent and able to maintaine and defend him that ſpeaketh truth, or to puniſh and take vengeance on him that ſweareth a lye, but God onely which is able to deſtroye both ſoule and bodie in hell? Secondly, if wee will ſweare lawfully wee muſt ſweare in truth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 4 2.</note> in iudgement, and in righteouſneſſe. In truth, for the confirmation of the truth, becauſe wee may not call God to witneſſe a lye, leaſt hee giue vs our portion with lyers and ſwearers, in the lake that euer burneth. In iudgement, vpon cauſes weighty, certaine, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, when the glorie of God, or the good of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour doth require it, becauſe we may not call God light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or raſhly to witneſſe vpon triall, or vncertainetie, or vnneceſſarie cauſes, leaſt our iudgement be as theirs that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:599:60"/> take his name in vaine. In righteouſnes, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of things godly, iuſt, and lawfull, becauſe wee may not call God to witnes things vngodly, vniuſt, or vnlawfull, leſt we be not holden guiltles for taking his name in vaine: for thus much thoſe three points imply. Thirdly, if we will ſweare lawfully, it muſt be when wee haue no other way of proofe of our words, or confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our promiſe: for if otherwiſe the thing for which we are to ſweare can be debated, decided, &amp; ended, then by an oath we are not to ſweare, as by the end of an oath it doth appeare, which is to <hi>end a ſtrife;</hi> ſo that where the ſtrife may otherwiſe be ended, there an oath is not to be vſed. Sweare then wee may lawfully, but not otherwiſe then by the name of God, and that in truth, and in iudgement, and in righteouſneſſe, and that when things cannot otherwiſe be cleared and ended then by an oath.</p>
                  <p>Which ſerueth firſt for the confutation of that error of the Anabaptiſts, who deny it to be lawfull for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſweare at all: the plaine contrary whereof wee haue heard euidently proued out of the ſcriptures. The places of ſcripture whereon they ground their error are two;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.34, 35, 36, 37. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12.</note> the one the ſaying of our bleſſed Sauiour in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew;</hi> the other the words of <hi>Iames</hi> in his Epiſtle. The ſaying of our Sauiour in <hi>Matthew</hi> is, <hi>Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God &amp;c.</hi> The words of <hi>Iames</hi> are, <hi>Before all things ſweare not, neither by heauen, nor by earth, nor by any other oath &amp;c.</hi> from both which places they conclude that a Chriſtian may not ſweare at all. For anſwer whereunto wee muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, 1. that not all kindes of othes are forbidden in theſe places. 2. what kinde of othes are there condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For the firſt, that not all kinde of othes are forbid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den in <hi>Mathew,</hi> appeareth by the very ſcope and drift of our Sauiour in that place. For what was his ſcope and drift there? It appeareth by his expoſition there of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry lawes, that his meaning was not to deſtroy the law,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:599:61"/> for ſo he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 17.</note> 
                     <hi>I came not to deſtroy the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> but his meaning was to purge the Law from the corrupt gloſſes of the Phariſees, and to open the true meaning of it, as he doth firſt in the Law touching mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then in the Law touching adulterie, and not in the Law touching ſwearing. The Law then not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſimply forbidden ſwearing, neither doth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſimply condemne ſwearing Againe, if all kindes of othes be ſimply here forbidden, and onely yea, and nay commanded, what ſhall we ſay for our Apoſtle that contenteth not himſelfe onely with <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay?</hi> What ſhall we ſay for our Sauiour himſelfe, that not therewith content ſaith, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you?</hi> And againe, othes being a part of Gods worſhip, as before we heard, if all kinde of othes be here forbidden a Chriſtian, then is a part of Gods worſhip forbidden and condemned. Seeing then thus it may appeare, that not all kindes of othes are here forbidden, let vs now ſee what kindes of othes are here forbidden and condemned. And this will appeare by a ſhort view of the corrupt gloſſes, which the Phariſees added to the Law touching ſwearing. The Law was, <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſweare thy ſelfe, but ſhalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thine othes to the Lord.</hi> Their gloſſe was, that if any ſweare by the name of God, or by the things that were immediatly belonging to the ſeruice of God, as by the gold of the Temple, or the offering on the Altar vainely or perfidiouſly, not performing his oath, he offendeth but if he ſweare by any other creature, as by heauen, or earth, or Ieruſalem, or his head, or the Temple, or the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or any that is not God, hee offendeth not, nor is bound to performe his oath. Our Sauiour his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law againſt their gloſſe is, that not onely to ſweare in our common talke by the name of God, but alſo to ſweare by any other creature is an offence againſt the Law. So that here are not forbidden othes made in truth, in iudgement, and in righteouſnes, but all othes in common talke, either by God, or by any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:599:61"/> or by any thing that is not God. Yea but it is ſaid, <hi>Sweare not at all.</hi> True, in common talke ſweare not at all, not by the name of God, for that the Law forbids, nor by any creature, although the Phariſees allow you, but let your communication be <hi>yea, yea; nay, nay.</hi> Nay I adde in great and weighty matters ſweare not at all, if any way you can auoide it, and when your <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> may be truſted: for whatſoeuer is more then <hi>yea and nay,</hi> alwaies commeth of euill, euen of the deuill in thee if thou ſweare of a wicked cuſtome, and of euill in him to whom thou ſweareſt, if hauing no cauſe to diſtruſt thy <hi>yea and nay,</hi> he doe not truſt thee but cauſe thee to ſweare. The like anſwer is to be made to that of <hi>Iames,</hi> who vſeth the very words of our Sauiour. Yea, but <hi>Iames</hi> addeth, <hi>Sweare not by heauen, nor earth, nor by any other oath.</hi> True, not vainely, or perfidiouſly. So that no oath by God, or any creature in common talke is lawfull for any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, nor in weighty and neceſſarie matters if wee can auoide it, but if wee cannot auoide it, an oath by the name of God in truth, in iudgement, and in righteouſnes is lawfull, the Anabaptiſts grounds as yee ſee prouing nothing to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond vſe of our obſeruation is, to reſtraine the wicked othes of the prophane ſwearers of our time. For firſt are we when we ſweare, only to ſweare by the name of God, &amp; not at all by any creature, or any thing that is not God? How then dareſt thou, whoſoeuer thou art, ſweare by the Maſſe, by thy faith, by thy troth, by our Lady, by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. George, or the like? Are theſe thy gods whom thou haſt made to ſerue them? Or dareſt thou giue the worſhip due vnto God, vnto any but vnto him? Did the Lord threaten ruine vpon <hi>Iſrael</hi> becauſe they ſwore by their idols in <hi>Dan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amos</hi> 8.14.</note> 
                     <hi>they that ſweare by the ſinne of Samaria, and ſay, thy God O Dan li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and the maner of Beerſheba liueth, euen they ſhall fail, &amp; neuer riſe vp againe,</hi> &amp; dareſt thou ſweare by that idoll of the Maſſe, which was the ſinne of England, and is the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:599:62"/> ſinne of Rome? Did the Lord tell <hi>Iudah</hi> that her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had forſaken the Lord, becauſe they ſwore by them that were no Gods, ſaying, <hi>Thy children haue forſaken me, and haue ſworne by them that are no gods,</hi>

                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.7.</note> and dareſt thou ſweare by our <hi>Lady,</hi> by <hi>S. George,</hi> by <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> or <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> or the like, which are no gods? Doeſt thou not ſee that thus ſwearing thou forſakeſt God, and bringeſt ruine vpon thy ſelfe? Did our bleſſed Sauiour tell the Scribes and Phariſees ſaying, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſweareth by the Altar ſweareth by it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.20, 21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>and by all things thereon; and whoſoeuer ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the Temple ſweareth by it, and him that dwelleth therein; and whoſoeuer ſweareth by heauen ſweareth by the throne of God, and by him that ſitteth thereon;</hi> and doeſt thou thinke that when thou ſweareſt by thy faith, thou ſweareſt not by him in whom thou beleeueſt; or when thou ſweareſt by thy troth, that thou ſweareſt not by him in whom thou truſteſt &amp;c? In one word, thou that commonly ſweareſt by any thing that is not God, tell me what thinkeſt thou, doeſt thou therein ſweare by God, or no? If ſo, then thou takeſt his name in vaine, and he will not hold thee guiltles. If no, then thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakeſt God, in that thou ſweareſt by that which is no God. And looke then what comes vpon thy ſwearing by any creature, or any thing that is not God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, are we when we ſweare not to ſweare by any creature, or any thing that is not God, but onely by the name of God, and not thereby, but onely in truth, in iudgement, and in righteouſnes, and when things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cannot be cleared and ended? How then dareſt thou, ô wretched man, in thine ordinarie talke, vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery fond and light occaſion, no neceſſitie of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or thy neighbors good vrging, ſweare by the holy name of God, and of Ieſus Chriſt? How doth not thy fleſh &amp; thy ſpirit tremble within thee? how doth it not pierce thy very heart and ſoule to ſweare by the life, by the body, by the ſides, by the wounds, by the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus? Doeſt thou, curſed wretch, hope to liue
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:599:62"/> by his life that ſweareſt by his life; hope to be benefited by his bodie, that ſweareſt by his body; hope to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his wounds, that ſweareſt by his wounds; hope to be waſhed from thy ſinnes by his bloud, that ſweareſt by his blod? Nay, thou that doſt theſe things, doſt crucifie againe vnto thy ſelfe the Sonne of God. Thou art one of them that ſpitteſt vpon him, and buffeteſt him, that nayleſt him vnto the croſſe, that thruſteſt thy ſpeare into his ſide, that art acceſſary to the death of that iuſt one, and his bloud ſhall ſurely be vpon thee, vnleſſe he grant thee grace vnto repentance. A pittifull caſe that a man can almoſt come into no place, into no companie, but he ſhall heare ſuch ordinarie ſwearing by the name of God, that euery third word almoſt ſhall be ſuch an oath. A pitifull caſe that a man cannot paſſe the ſtreets, but he ſhall heare little ones that haue little more then learned to ſpeake, yet ſweare wickedly by the name of God. And yet ſo it is, as if our yong ones had neuer learned to ſpeake, till they had learned to ſweare, and as if the elder ſort had neuer ſpoken well, till they had ſworne luſtily. A great many thinke themſelues no bodie, vnleſſe they can ſweare it with the beſt, and that it is their credit to ſweare ſtoutly. But wretched credit with men, that is got with the loſſe of Gods fauour: and better no bodie, then ſuch a ſwearing bodie. Heare the word of the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Zachary, this</hi> ſaith he <hi>is the curſe that goeth forth ouer the whole earth:</hi>

                     <hi>for euery one that ſtealeth ſhall be cut off, aſwell on this ſide as on that, and euery one that ſweareth &amp;c.</hi> Enough a man would thinke to make the ſwearers countenance change, and his knees to ſmite one againſt another.</p>
                  <p>Let this be enough, beloued, to warne you of this foule ſinne of ſwearing, and to reſtraine you from it. Sweare not at all in your common talke, either by God, for then he will not hold you guiltles; or by any thing that is not God, for then yee forſake God, but <hi>let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay.</hi> Let not your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

You muſt all of you know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that his name is glorious and fearefull, that he is a ielous God and a conſuming fire, and therefore ye may not thinke or ſpeake of him, but with reuerence and humbleneſſe, with feare and trembling.

                     <hi>for as a ſeruant which is often puniſhed cannot be without ſome skarre, ſo hee that ſweareth and nameth God continually, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed for ſuch things.</hi> Haue your faith and your troth with God, but let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay, <hi>for whatſoeuer is more then this commeth of euill.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my dwelling on this point, being ſo needfull to be ſpoken of, and hauing occaſion but ſeldome to ſpeake of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I note, is the thing whereof the Apoſtle maketh ſuch vehement proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is his ſincere loue of the <hi>Philippians.</hi> Hee proteſteth and taketh God to witnes, that he longeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them all, or greatly loueth them all from the very heart roote in Ieſus Chriſt. Whence I obſerue how the Paſtor ought to be affected towards his people, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally one Chriſtian towards another, and that is thus, the Paſtor ought to loue his people, and one Chriſtian ought to loue another, euen with ſincere loue. <hi>Owe nothing</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>to any man, but to loue one another.</hi> Which rule is generall for all Chriſtians, and conteineth in it two good inſtructions; the one, to flie debt, that we ſhould
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:599:63"/> not owe any thing one to another; the other, to follow after loue, that wee ſhould loue one another. And wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto <hi>Timothie</hi> more particularly, hee noteth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors loue of his people, where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Be an enſample vnto them that belieue in word, in conuerſation, in loue;</hi> in loue I ſay, that as they ſee your loue to be towards them, ſo their loue may be one towards another: euen as the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 3.12.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord encreaſe you, and make you to abound in loue one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and towards all men, euen as we do towards you.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his loue towards them is ſignified, the loue which ſhould be in the Paſtor towards his flocke, that as his is towards them, ſo theirs might be one towards another.</p>
                  <p>But ſince there are ſo many ſleights in loue, how can Chriſtians ſhew that they loue one another, and Paſtors that they loue their people euen with ſincere loue? that is, our loue muſt be a great loue, ſo great, that if we be abſent from them whome wee loue, we long after them with a longing deſire to ſee them, that if we be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, wee may beſtowe ſome ſpirituall comfort among them, and if otherwiſe, that we may performe ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue vnto them. Such was our Apoſtles loue to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as he witneſſeth, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11.</note> that <hi>hee longed to ſee them, that he might bestow vpon them ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall guift to ſtrengthen them.</hi> Such alſo was <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> loue towards theſe <hi>Philippians,</hi> as our Apoſtle witneſſeth in the next chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. And ſuch was his owne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as this place ſheweth. And ſuch after their example, muſt bee the loue of all Paſtors towards their people, and of all Chriſtians one towards another, if their loue be ſincere. Yea, but ſuch and ſo great may be their loue one towards another, as that they greatly long and deſire to ſee one another, and yet their loue be not heartie, but full of diſſimulation. True, and therefore a ſecond qualitie is requiſite in ſincere loue, namely, that it be without diſſimulation, <hi>euen from the very heart roote.</hi> Such loue our Apoſtle requireth in all Chriſtians one
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:599:64"/> towards another,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9.</note> ſaying, <hi>Let loue bee without diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22.</note> And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Loue one another with a pure heart feruently.</hi> Such was our Apoſtles loue towards the <hi>Philippians,</hi> louing and longing after them <hi>from the very heart roote:</hi> and ſuch muſt be the loue of all Paſtors towards their people, and of all Chriſtians one towards another, if their loue bee ſincere. Yea, but yet ſuch, and ſo great may bee their loue one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that they long one after another, <hi>euen from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart roote,</hi> and yet their loue be not ſincere, but after the fleſh, as the manner of many carnall men and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings is to loue;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.3.</note> as we ſee that <hi>Shechems</hi> heart claue vnto <hi>Dinah.</hi> True, and therefore yet a third qualitie is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in ſincere loue, namely, that it be in the Lord, euen in Chriſt Ieſus, a ſpirituall, holy, and ſanctified loue in Chriſt, and for him. Such was our Apoſtles loue towards the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7.</note> as himſelfe witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>We were gentle among you, euen as a Nurſe cheriſheth her Children. Thus being affectioned towards you,</hi>

                     <hi>our good will was to haue dealt vnto you, not the Goſpell of God onely, but alſo our owne ſoules, becauſe ye were deare vnto vs.</hi> And a little after he ſaith,<note place="margin">11.</note> 
                     <hi>We exhorted you, and comforted, and beſought euery one of you, as a father his children.</hi> And ſuch, hee taketh God to witneſſe, his loue was towards the <hi>Philippians.</hi> And ſtill the precepts runne, to loue one another in the Lord, and ſuch muſt be the loue of Paſtors towards their people, and of Chriſtians one towards another, if their loue be ſincere, they muſt long after them in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from them, and that <hi>from the very heart roote,</hi> and that <hi>in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Paſtors ſhould examine their loue towards their people, and Chriſtians their loue one towards another by this rule; how much ſincere loue (thinke yee) would there bee found either in Chriſtians generally, or in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors particularly?

And why doth he pray for their growth and increaſe in theſe things? Euen for theſe ends; 1. that they may diſcerne things that differ one from another, good from bad, and vncorrupt from corrupt doctrine. 2. that they may be pure from ſtaine or corruption in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:599:66"/> doctrine, faith, or maners. 3. that they may be without offence, neither ſlipping backe, nor ſtanding at a ſtay, but holding on a conſtant courſe vntill the day of Chriſt. 4. that they may be filled with the fruits of righteouſnes, abounding in euery good worke, which are by Ieſus Chriſt, from whom they haue their beginning, vnto the glory and praiſe of God, which is their end. Theſe were the ends for which he praied, <hi>that their loue might abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the things principally to bee noted in theſe words, are three; Firſt, the Apoſtles action of praying, <hi>This I pray.</hi> Secondly, the things for which he praied, which were three, 1. their increaſe in loue. 2. their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in knowledge. 3. their inereaſe in iudgement. Thirdly, the ends wherefore he praied for theſe things vnto them, which were foure, as euen now we heard. Now let vs ſee what notes we may gather hence for our farther vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle praied for the <hi>Philippians, that their loue might abound yet more and more &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Philippians</hi> abounded in loue, in knowledge, and in iudgment, yet ſtill the Apoſtle praied that they might abound yet more and more in theſe things. Whence 1. I obſerue the continuall vſe and neceſſitie of praier: whatſoeuer graces the Lord haue beſtowed on vs, yet ſtill we haue neede to pray, euen that we may yet more and more abound in thoſe very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore the Apoſtles exhortation is, <hi>Pray continually,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17.</note> whether yee be in aduerſitie, or in proſperity, whether yee want, or yee haue, yet <hi>pray continually.</hi> If ye want, that he may ſupply your wants, and giue vnto you, which giueth vnto all men liberally, and reprocheth no man.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5.</note> For ſo <hi>Iames</hi> exhorteth, ſaying, <hi>If any man lacke wiſdome,</hi> which is there meant of wiſdome to endure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently afflictions, but it is true in all graces generally, if any man lacke any grace, <hi>let him aske of God which giueth to all men liberally, and reprocheth no man, and it ſhall bee
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:599:66"/> giuen him.</hi> So likewiſe if yee haue, yet pray continually that yee may increaſe and abound, and if yee abound, yet pray continually that you may abound yet more and more in thoſe graces wherein yee abound. So wee ſee the Apoſtle praied for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.12.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord increaſe you, and make you abound in loue one towards another, and towards all men.</hi> In the firſt chapter hee had commended their diligent loue: ſo that it was not for the hauing of that which they lacked that the Apoſtle praied, but for their increaſing and abounding in that grace which they had. And ſo here our Apoſtle praied for the <hi>Philippians, that they might abound yet more and more &amp;c.</hi> What, was it for the hauing of that which they lacked that hee praied? No. Was it that they might abound in that which they had? Nor onely ſo: but that they might more and more abound in thoſe graces wherein already they abounded. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle thus praying for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that they might increaſe and abound in that grace which already they had; and for the <hi>Philippians</hi> that they might increaſe and abound more and more in thoſe graces, wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready they abounded, therein taught them, and in them vs, that we are to make our requeſts vnto God in praier and ſupplication, as for the hauing of ſuch graces as we want, ſo that we may increaſe and abound in thoſe graces w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we haue, &amp; that we may abound ſtill more &amp; more in thoſe graces wherein already we doe abound. So that whatſoeuer graces we haue, ſtill we are to pray that wee may continually more and more abound therein. And the reaſon why wee are continually ſo to pray is very plaine: for 1. ſuch is our weaknes through the ſinne that hangeth ſo faſt on vs, that vnto whatſoeuer meaſure of grace we be growne, yet ſtand therein we cannot, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he doe continually ſtay vs and vphold vs with his hand. Let <hi>Peter</hi> witnes, whoſe faith faileth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.31.</note> and he ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, if the Lord ſuſteine him not, and ſaue him. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo may witnes the ſame, whoſe courage in his bands may
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:599:67"/> faile him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.20.</note> if by the power of the ſpirit through the praier of the Saints hee be not aſſiſted, that therein hee may ſpeake boldly as he ought. In regard therefore of our vnablenes to ſtand or grow, without his continuall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſupply, ſtill we had need to pray vnto the Lord, whatſoeuer meaſure of grace we be growne vnto. 2. In whatſoeuer grace we abound, yet therein, we come ſo far ſhort of that perfection wherein we ſhould endeuour, that continually we had neede to pray that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound yet more and more therein. And therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> that was well taught in the Lord his ſtatutes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.</note> yet ſtill praieth vnto the Lord to teach him his ſtatutes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more vnderſtanding then all his teachers, yet ſtill praied vnto the Lord to giue him vnderſtanding; and taking as great delight in the way of his teſtimonies, as in all manner of riches, yet ſtill praieth vnto the Lord, that he will incline his heart vnto his teſtimonies. And what was this, but his praier that hee might abound yet more in the knowledge, and in the vnderſtanding, and in the delight of the Law of the Lord, becauſe howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee abounded therein, yet he came farre ſhort of that he ſhould? And for the ſame reaſon it behoueth vs ſo to doe, as we haue him for an enſample.</p>
                  <p>This then may ſerue, to condemne our great negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſlacknes, our great coldnes and faintnes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, both in publique and priuate praier vnto the Lord our God. For is there ſo continuall vſe and neceſſitie of praier, whether we want any grace that we may haue it, or haue any grace that we may increaſe and abound in it, or abound in any grace, that we may abound yet more and more in it? How then is it, that we are ſo negligent and ſlacke, ſo cold and faint in praier generally? Vnto publique praier wherein we pray for what we want, and for increaſe in that we haue, and that we may more and more abound in that wherein we abound, how negligent and ſlacke are we, and how cold and faint are we therein? Some of vs come ſo ſeldome thereunto as that there is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:599:67"/> very little difference betweene vs, and plaine Recuſants; others of vs come ſo ſlowly thereunto, as that we come, as they ſay it is good to come to a fray, to the end of it; others of vs in time of publique praier are occupied ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in priuate praiers, or in reading vpon ſome booke or other, or in talking one vnto another; others of vs either fall aſleepe, or are troubled with wandring and by-thoughts, and haue our mindes at home, or in the fields, vpon our commodities, or vpon our pleaſures, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon euery thing then vpon that we ſhould. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo defectiue and wanting vnto our duties wee are herein, as if either we knew not, or cared not how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, and how to carry our ſelues in publique praier. And as we faile of that we ought in publique, ſo doe wee alſo in priuate praier. For how ſeldome doe we, as our bleſſed Sauiour willeth vs, <hi>enter into our chambers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſhut our doores vpon vs, and pray vnto our father which is in ſecret?</hi> Can our wants preſſe vs to pray priuately vnto the Lord that he will ſupply our wants? Nay ſeldome wee humble our ſelues in priuate before the Lord, euen for the ſupply of our wants; or if we doe, our praiers are ſo cold, and ſo faint, and ſo troubled with wandring and by thoughts, that we pray and haue not, becauſe we pray not as wee ought. Can the graces which we haue, and wherein we abound, preſſe vs to pray priuately vnto the Lord that we may increaſe in thoſe graces we haue, and abound yet more &amp; more in thoſe wherein we abound? Nay here commonly we forget our ſelues, and as if we were well and needed no more, wee pray not vnto the Lord for increaſe, but carrying our ſelues like vnto the Phariſee, we thinke we are not as other men, and we ſay depart from mee, for I am more holy, more learned, more wiſe, more ſober, more modeſt, more patient then thou, and forget God by whom we are ſo. Surely not the beſt of vs all, but we are guilty of very many defects touching praier. Let vs therefore hereafter vſe more carefullneſſe herein then heretofore we haue done. Let
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:599:68"/> vs reforme our negligence and ſlackneſſe in comming to publique prayer. It hath the promiſe, that where two or three bee gathered together in Gods name,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 18.20.</note> there will he be in the middeſt of them; and oftentimes hee bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs, becauſe of them that pray with vs. Let vs pray in faith, and wauer not, <hi>and whatſoeuer we aske in prayer, if we belieue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>we ſhall ſurely receaue it.</hi> Let vs not ceaſe, but in publike, and in priuate, powre out our prayers vnto the Lord, both for ſuch graces as wee want, and for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in ſuch as we haue, and that we may abound more and more in euery good grace. Continuall neede wee haue: let vs therefore, as the Apoſtle exhorteth, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> euen whatſoeuer graces wee haue, let vs pray that we may abound more and more therein.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which hence I obſerue is, that Chriſtians are not to ſtand at a ſtaie, or to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with reaſonable good beginnings, but whatſoeuer grace it is wherein they ſtand, they are continually to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that they may abound more and more therein. Which, as this place ſheweth, ſo farther that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Therefore, leauing the doctrine of the beginning of Chriſt, let vs be led forward vnto perfection.</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſhewes, that wee are not alwaies to be a learning the principles and beginnings of Religion, but as children which at the firſt are fed with milke, doe afterwards take and digeſt ſtrong meate; ſo from principles in religion, we ſhould goe forward vnto perfection in religion, growing vp daily more and more in the vnity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God into a perfect man. Adde herevnto the example of our Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.12.</note> he hauing attained vnto a great meaſure of perfection, yet counted not himſelfe that hee had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto it, but hee followed hard after it, that hee might comprehend it, and ſtill endeauoured himſelfe vnto that which was before. In whoſe example (as in a glaſſe) we may ſee that we are not to reſt in any perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we can grow vnto in this life, but ſtill we are to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:599:68"/> go forward from perfection to perfection, and ſtill to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to encreaſe and abound more and more in euery grace wherewith wee are bleſſed. And how ſhould any man thinke othewiſe, conſidering what enemies we haue which hinder our perfection. For, can we haue the diuell euer ſeeking like a roaring Lyon to deuour vs, the world laying a thouſand baites to deceaue vs, our owne fleſh as a ſtrong armed man euermore aſſaulting vs, ſo that our whole liues bee a continuall ſharpe warfare vnto vs, and yet hope for ſuch perfection in this life, that wee neede not ſtriue farther? Nay, theſe continually bid vs ſuch battaile that if either wee ſtand or giue backe, wee may quickely take the foyle. Still therefore, wee muſt hold on, and as long as the Lord continues our life, ſo long we muſt giue all diligence to abound more and more in euerie grace wherein we ſtand.</p>
                  <p>This then ſerueth to condemne the miſerable corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our times, for ſo it is with vs, that a great many of vs rather go backeward, and growe worſe and worſe, then better and better. Many which ſeemed to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne in the ſpirit, make an end in the fleſh; which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for a time to haue runne well with the <hi>Galathians,</hi> are with them drawen away with diuers luſts, which drowne them in perdition. Others of vs pawſe at the matter, and, as if there were danger in euery ſtep farther, we ſtand at a ſtay and moue not our foote forward. But what doe I ſay, that wee ſtand at a ſtay? Nay, indeede, and in truth, we plainely go backeward: for not to go forward in the way of Chriſtianitie, is to goe backeward; and not to encreaſe in the graces of Gods ſpirit, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in them! And therefore the iudgement of the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> becauſe they were not hot, was as if they had been cold, euen to be ſpewed out of the Lord his mouth.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.16.</note> Others of vs can be content to make a ſhew of going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and encreaſing in religion and pietie, but it is for our aduantage an gaine, that vnder a colour of zeale and forwardneſſe, we may the better compaſſe our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:599:69"/> and bring our purpoſes to paſſe: for we like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the account that gaine ſhould bee godlineſſe, then that godlineſſe ſhould be gaine, and againe we will make of a ſhew of godlineſſe. The leaſt number by farre is of them that hauing begun well, doe in their ſoules labour after perfection, that they may abound more and more in the grace wherein they ſtand. But let our care, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, be, to be of this number. Let vs ſo ſtriue after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that we may daily grow from perfection to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, till we become perfect men in Chriſt Ieſus. Let vs continually pray with the Apoſtles, <hi>Lord encreaſe our faith;</hi> and let vs labour by all holy meanes of hearing the word preached, and reuerent vſe of the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to growe more and more in faith. Let vs pray with the Prophet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Stabliſh the thing (O God) that thou haſt wrought in vs;</hi> and let vs labour to bee daily more and more grounded &amp; ſtabliſhed in euery grace that the Lord hath wrought in vs. And if alreadie we do thus, let vs comfort our ſelues in this that we doe as we ought, and let vs hold on our good courſe vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle prayeth, that <hi>their loue might abound more and more;</hi> their loue towards God, their loue one towards another, their loue towards the poore Saints and afflicted members of Chriſt Ieſus. Whence I obſerue, that in all Chriſtians this muſt bee a continuall care, that they may abound alwaies more and more in loue towards God, in loue one towards another, and in loue towards the poore Saints and afflicted members of Chriſt Ieſus. For, firſt, touching the loue of God, how can we loue him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, who ſo loued vs, euen when we were enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that hee ſent his onely begotten ſonne into the world to ſuffer death for vs, that we might liue through him? This was loue paſſing the loue of women, and how ſhould wee loue him that thus loued vs firſt? Sure our care can neuer bee enough, that ſtill wee may more and more abound in loue towards him. Againe, touching
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:599:69"/> the loue one of another, we ſee how the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Lord encreaſe you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and make you to abound in loue one towards another, and towards all men.</hi> Which his prayer for them, was a plaine ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that care which was behoouefull to be in them, namely that they might encreaſe and abound daily more and more in mutuall loue one towards another, and not in them onely, but in vs alſo, vnto whoſe edification and inſtruction thoſe things were plainely written. Alſo, touching our loue towards the poore Saints and afflicted members of Chriſt Ieſus; we ſee how the Apoſtle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and vrgeth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</note> and in them vs therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, commending their good beginning, and exhorting them by the example of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and of our bleſſed Sauiour, to continue, and to abound more and more therein. But, what ſhould farther proofe of this poynt need then this, that loue and charitie towards the poore Saints is ſo often commanded, and commended in the holy Scriptures, and ſo greatly rewarded? for the oftener that it is commaunded and commended in the holy Scriptures; and the more, that it is rewarded, the more carefull it behooueth vs to be, that wee abound therein. <hi>Thou ſhalt not harden thine heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 15 7.11.</note> 
                     <hi>nor ſhut thine hand from thy poore brother, but thou ſhalt open thine hand vnto thy brother, to thy needy and to thy poore in the land, ſaith the Lord: Thou ſhalt not harden thine heart, but open thy bowels of compaſſion, and bee mercifull, and louing, and tender-hearted towards thy poore brother.</hi> The like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is often giuen in the holy Scripture. And what a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation was it generally vnto the Churches of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that out of their moſt extreame pouerty, they were ſo richly liberall vnto the poore afflicted Saints, and perticularly vnto theſe <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they communicated to our Apoſtle in his bands? Or what greater reward can be giuen vnto any, then is promiſed vnto them that giue the Saints meate when they are hungrie, that giue them drinke when they are thirſtie,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:599:70"/> that cloath them when they are naked, that viſite them when they are ſicke, that relieue them when they are in priſon, &amp;c. euen a kingdome of glorie? In a poynt ſo cleare, many proofes are not needfull. For more care is not needfull, that we may encreaſe and abound more and more in faith, hope, or other grace of the ſpirit, then that wee may abound more and more in loue, euen in loue, both towards God, and towards one another, and towards the poore Saints in their affliction and miſerie.</p>
                  <p>Which ſerueth to condemne the more then keicolde loue of Chriſtians in our daies. To cenſure any of you ſo ſharpely, beloued, as if yee loued not God, or at leaſt but with a colde loue, would ſeeme it may be hard. For all of you loue God, and hee that thinketh otherwiſe is much deceaued. But, tell me, do all of you loue one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? It may be that ſome of you will here yeeld a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8.</note> And, I tell you, or rather the holy Ghoſt telleth you, that <hi>hee that loueth not his brother, whome he hath ſeene, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not God, whom he hath not ſeene.</hi> The Apoſtles exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, <hi>Bee affectioned to loue one another, with brotherly loue:</hi> And againe, <hi>Let brotherly loue continue:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Aboue all things haue feruent loue amongst you.</hi> But our often brawlings, and diuiſions, and quarrels, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and ſwellings, and diſcords ſhew, that wee haue not hearkened nor obeyed their counſell, ſo farre haue we been from abounding more and more in loue one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another? And if we doe not loue one another as wee ſhould, iudge yee by the former place whether wee loue God as we ſhould.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>how good &amp; ioyfull a thing it is brethren to dwell together in vnity.</hi> Surely in any thing we cannot be liker vnto God, then if we loue one another: for God is loue, and wee by loue are made Gods houſe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.16.</note> wherein he liketh to dwell; <hi>For he that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> We haue beene too colde in loue one towards another, and therefore too colde in loue towards our God. Aboue all things let vs haue feruent loue amongſt our ſelues, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:599:70"/> ſo ſhall we be ſure that we loue God indeed. And as we haue beene too colde in loue one towards another, and conſequently in loue towards God, ſo can I not much commend our loue towards the poore Saints and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted members of Chriſt Ieſus. I cannot reprooue you for not abounding more and more in this loue, becauſe, as yet, you do not abound in this loue. Through a good and godly ſtatute lately made, the poore Saints come not now vnto your doores; but through want of reliefe they faint in their houſes: inſomuch, that as the children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> when their burthen was heauier, and their taske greater, cryed out vpon <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Lord looke vpon you and iudge, for ye haue made our ſauiour to ſtinke before Pharaoh and his ſeruants, in that ye haue put a ſword in their hand to ſlay vs:</hi> So they cry out vpon them that were the meanes of this ſtatute, ſaying, <hi>The Lord looke vpon them that haue done thus vnto vs, for they haue made our ſauiour to ſtinke before our brethren, and haue put a ſword in their hands to ſlay vs.</hi> And where is the cauſe of this cry? Not in the ſtatute: for it is as good a ſtatute as could be deuiſed both for you and them: but the cauſe is in you. Ye are well content that they come not to your doores as they were woont; but there wanteth in you a willing and readie mind to contribute to their neceſſities as the ſtatute requireth. When ſome taske or burthen ſhould be leuied vpon you for their maintenance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that reliefe, which they were woont to finde at your doores, here ye draw back the ſhoulder, and euerie man would giue ſo little, that the ſtatute cannot haue his entendment. And thus it is that you haue a ſword to kill the poore withall: for, by the ſtatute, they may not come to your doores, &amp; yet you will not contribute to their maintenance according vnto the ſtatute. Beloued, open the bowels of your compaſſion, let your loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poore Saints appeare, communicate to their affliction, miſerie, and pouerty, and as God hath giuen to euerie man, ſo let him giue, not grudgingly, or of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:599:71"/> neceſſitie, but willingly and cheerefully. They are Gods ſaints, they are members of Chriſts bodie, they are your brethren, and many of them it may be as rich in Gods fauour as the moſt of you, and that which yee willingly and cheerefully now giue vnto them, ſhall further your reckoning in the day of Chriſt Ieſus. Be therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to giue, and glad to diſtribute, laying vp in ſtore for your ſelues a good foundation againſt the time to come. Let your loue towards God, towards one another, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poore ſaints of Chriſt Ieſus be manifeſt vnto all men, that they which ſee your loue may glorifie God on your behalfe. So ſhall yee be loued of loue it ſelfe, and liue for euer where your loue ſhall haue none end.</p>

                     <hi>My brethren,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>be not children in vnderſtanding, but as concerning maliciouſnes be children, but in vnderſtanding be of a ripe age.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had before, ſignified his owne minde of praying and ſpeaking in ſtrange tongues without vnderſtanding, and in a knowne tongue with vnderſtanding, therein taxing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:599:71"/> their too great admiring of ſtrange tongues, and too lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle regard of knowledge and vnderſtanding. Now in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hee tells them that therein they are like vnto little children, which if they ſee faire and great and coloured letters in a booke, are in great loue with the letters, but care not for the ſenſe and vnderſtanding of the words. But he exhorteth them, <hi>be not children in vnderſtanding,</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, Children indeed care not for vnderſtanding, but it may not be ſo with you, yee were children ſometimes and cared not for vnderſtanding, and yee were children ſometimes, and but yong in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge, but yee may not be ſo ſtill, but yee muſt grow to be of a ripe age in vnderſtanding, yee muſt increaſe in knowledge as in yeeres yee doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. And leſt they ſhould ſay that Chriſt would haue them to <hi>be like vnto little children,</hi> he preuenteth that,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 18 3.</note> and tells them that he would haue them to be like vnto lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children <hi>concerning maliciouſneſſe,</hi> but concerning knowledge and vnderſtanding he would haue them to be no children, but of <hi>a ripe age.</hi> So that hence we ſee that our care is to be that we be not children, but men of a ripe age touching vnderſtanding, .i. that wee may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and grow forward more and more in knowledge, euen from knowledge to knowledge To the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Leauing the doctrine of the beginnings of Chriſt, let vs be led forward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfection.</hi> He had in the end of the former chapter, ſomewhat ſharply told the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that <hi>when as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time they ought to be teachers, yet they had neede to be taught the very principles of the word of God.</hi> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth exhort them that they would not be ſtill a learning the principles and beginnings of religion, but that they would goe forward from perfection to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and abound more and more in knowledge. We may not then be as idle loyterers, which ſpend their time and profit not, but as our time ſpent in the ſchoole of Chriſt doth require of vs, ſo muſt our profiting be in the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:599:72"/> knowledge of his will out of his word. Yea looke into our owne practiſe, and we ſhall finde our owne iudgment to be ſuch. If wee haue children, and ſet them to their books, we looke that according to their time ſpent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at their profiting ſhould be, and that they ſhould increaſe in knowledge and learning, as they grow in yeares, and in time ſpent at their booke, and if they doe not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, we take them from the ſchoole and ſet them to ſome other thing. So that by our owne iudgement, ſo many of vs as are taught in the ſchoole of Chriſt, we ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the knowledge of Chriſt, and as we ſpend more and more time in the ſchoole of Chriſt, ſo ſhould wee abound more and more in the knowledge of Chriſt, and if we doe not ſo, by our owne iudgements we are to bee excluded as <hi>non proficients</hi> out of the ſchoole of Chriſt. And what then becomes of vs? Nothing then to ſet vs vnto, but as it was ſaid to the vnprofitable ſeruant, <hi>Caſt that vnprofitable ſeruant into vtter darknes, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30.</note> ſo ſhall it be ſaid to ſuch <hi>non proficients,</hi> caſt that <hi>non proficient ſcholar</hi> into vtter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
                  <p>This then, firſt may teach vs to beware of that leauen of theirs that would haue vs miſled vp in ignorance, and beare the world in hand that <hi>ignorance is the mother of deuotion.</hi> For ſuch a brood of Sathan there is, as will tell you that the Scriptures are darke, and hard to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and perilous to bee read; that will highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your modeſtie, if yee preſume not to read the Scriptures; that will tell you it is enough for you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as the Church beleeueth, though yee know not how to giue account of your faith; that will allow well of learning nothing, and after many yeares to be neuer the wiſer; in a word, that will the ſooner ſuſpect you of hereſie, the more knowledge yee haue in the Scriptures. Such are they that would haue praying, ſinging, reading, and all other rites of the Church done in a ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that would haue vs barred from the reading of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:599:72"/> the Scriptures in a knowne tongue, that would haue none but great Clerks and Diuines ſeene in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But what ſaith the Holy Ghoſt? <hi>Search the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Sauiour,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>for in them yee thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which teſtifie of me. Grow</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> vnto the Church, <hi>in grace,</hi>

                        <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.</note> And in this place his praier is for the Church of <hi>Philippi, that they may abound more and more in knowledge.</hi> Now what can be more contrary and repugnant vnto other, then this doctrine of the Holy Ghoſt vnto that doctrine of theirs? Our bleſſed Sauiour ſets vs vnto the Scriptures to ſearch them, and they would not haue vs to preſume to read the Scriptures. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> would haue vs to <hi>grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and they would not haue vs looke into the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures leſt we fall into hereſies. Our Apoſtle would haue <hi>the word of Chriſt to dwell in vs plenteouſly,</hi> and they would haue vs onely to beleeue as the Church beleeueth, and care not though we know not how to giue account of our faith. Our Apoſtle would haue vs <hi>to abound more and more in knowledge,</hi> and they tell vs that ignorance is the mother of deuotion. See then whether there be not cauſe to beware of them, and to bid fie vpon the beaſt, that ſpeaketh ſo preſumptuouſly againſt the word of God. As the Apoſtle ſaith vnto the <hi>Galatians</hi> touching the falſe Apoſtles, <hi>they deſire to haue you circumciſed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.13.</note> 
                     <hi>that they might reioyce in your fleſh;</hi> ſo I ſay vnto you touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe falſe Apoſtles, they deſire to haue you cloſe ſhut vp in ignorance, that they may lead you blindfold at their pleaſures into all their deuiliſh errors, and that they may reioyce in their aduantage by your ignorance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore of them, and hearken not vnto them, leſt if yee erre in your hearts, becauſe yee know not his waies through your ignorance in the ſcriptures, he ſweare as ſometimes he did vnto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in his wrath, that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:599:73"/> yee ſhall neuer enter into his reſt, euen to the heauenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereof that earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This may teach vs to giue all diligence vnto the reading, and hearing, and meditating of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, that ſo we may abound more and more in all knowledge and vnderſtanding. Very lamentable it is, beloued, to ſee and conſider how many hundreths, nay thouſands in this cleare light of the goſpell, when the ſcriptures are or may be read and knowne of vs all, yet are as ignorant in the ſcriptures, and of the things that belong to their ſaluation, as when they ſate in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when they could ſee no light of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by reaſon of the ſtrange language. We haue had many <hi>Ezraes</hi> that haue read in the booke of the law of God diſtinctly, &amp; giuen the ſenſe thereof that the reſt might vnderſtand; many Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus, that haue read the law &amp; the goſpell vnto vs euery Sabbath day in our Churches; many Preachers of the Goſpel that haue plainly opened the ſcriptures vnto vs, whereby we might be made wiſe vnto ſaluation, euen 40 yeares long And haue not the ſcriptures beene read vnto the greateſt number of vs in vaine? Notwithſtanding ſo much prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and teaching of the holy word of life, are we not ſtill ignorant, and haue ſtill neede to be taught the very beginnings of Chriſt, the very principles of religion? Haue we not many maſters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues great men, like vnto <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that know not thoſe things, which the very babes in Chriſts ſchoole ought to know?

Haue we not many that if they be asked, are not able to giue an account of their faith, nor know truth from er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ror, religion from ſuperſtition?

In the Bible, there yee haue the whole will of your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, there yee ſhall ſee what legacies he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed vnto you, and what duties he requireth of you. If the father of our bodies had bequeathed vs a great le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie by his will, it would not be much needfull to wiſh vs get our Fathers will, and to looke diligently into it, to ſee if not what he requireth of vs, yet what he bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth to vs, neither would wee ſticke at the coſt for the ſearch of it, if we knew where to haue it. And ſhall the father of our ſoules leaue vs his Will, and by his Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath vs euerlaſting life, and ſhall we not labour to get his Will? Shall a matter of ten ſhillings ſtay vs from the hauing of his Will? ſhall not we ſearch it and looke diligently into it?

If the children of our bodies had gone to the ſchoole, and in the ſpace of ſeauen yeares had profited nothing, what would we ſay vnto them, or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:599:74"/> thinke of them? Hardly enough, no doubt. And what ſhall we then thinke of our ſelues, that in the ſpace of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares, are ſcarce yet paſt our <hi>A. B.

Let vs hereafter recompence our former negligence, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diligence, and let vs ſlacke no holy meanes, whereby we may growe into all holy knowledge. Let vs labour to be rich in all knowledge, and leauing the doctrine of the beginning of Chriſt, let vs be led forward vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Let vs henceforth be no more children, waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and carried about with euerie winde of doctrine, but let vs grow vp vnto a perfect man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, that we may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the loue of Chriſt, which paſſeth all knowledge, that we may be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all fulneſſe of God. By reading, by hearing, by meditating, by praying, let your care bee <hi>to abound more and more in knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that <hi>they may abound more and more in all iudgement,</hi> in all iudgement, that is, in ſound iudgement, that hauing their wits exerciſed through long cuſtome, they may diſcerne both good and euill. So that, as hee would haue them to abound more and more in knowledge, ſo farther, he would haue them alſo to abound more and more, in a ſound and feeling experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſpirituall things in themſelues, that they might ſpiritually feele in their hearts and ſoules that which they knew out of the word. Whence I obſerue a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall care neceſſarie for all Chriſtians, and that is, that they may abound daily more and more, not in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely of Gods will out of his word, but in ſound iudgement alſo, through a feeling experience in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, of ſuch ſpirituall things as they know out of the word, that what they know out of the word, they may feele the truth of it by experience in themſelues. This
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:599:74"/> care our Apoſtle ſheweth that hee had, where hee ſaith, that the thing which he eſteemed was <hi>to know Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and the vertue of his reſurrection.</hi> Hee knew the doctrine of Chriſt his reſurrection, and hee knew this to be the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſt his reſurrection, that by it the Saints of God riſe from the death of ſinne vnto the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. But his deſire farther was, that he might feele in himſelfe, and know by his owne experience the vertue of Chriſt his reſurrection, by the death of ſinne, and the life of righteouſneſſe in himſelfe, that as he knew by the word <hi>Chriſt his reſurrection,</hi> to haue ſuch a vertue; ſo by experience in himſelfe he might know Chriſt his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to haue ſuch a vertue. And this care the Prophet exhorteth all men vnto, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Taſte and ſee how gracious the Lord is.</hi> Where yee may not thinke that the Prophet ſpeaketh, as if the gracious goodneſſe of the Lord could be taſted on with the mouth, or ſeene with the eye, but his meaning is, that ſuch is the gracious goodneſſe of the Lord vnto his children, that they may haue as ſound experimentall knowledge thereof, as if they ſhould taſte it with their mouths, or ſee it with their eyes. It is then as if the Prophet had thus ſaid, <hi>Know yee doe the gracious goodneſſe of the Lord, by his manifolde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi> and more then ſo, yee may know it by your owne experience. Acknowledge therefore him to bee gracious, whom by your own experimentall knowledge ye doe (as it were) taſte and ſee to be gracious. As then the Prophet doth exhort vs, and as our Apoſtle both by example and exhortation moueth vs, our care ſhould be that beſides our knowledge out of the word, we might haue a feeling knowledge of that wee know out of the word, by experience in our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>This then ſhould teach vs to obſerue the mercies and iudgements of the Lord, to obſerue the proofe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in our daily life, of ſuch things as wee know by the word, that ſo we may haue not a contemplatiue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but an experimentall knowledge of things in our
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:599:75"/> ſelues. As for example, the ſcripture telleth vs, that <hi>the poore crieth and the Lord heareth him, and ſaueth him out of all his troubles.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.6.</note> This we know to be true, becauſe wee finde it ſo in the word. But our care ſhould be farther to know it by a feeling experience in our owne ſelues. We muſt then obſerue the mercies of the Lord in hearing vs when we call vpon him, and deliuering vs in euery need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full time of trouble, &amp; ſo ſhall we know not only by the word, but by experience in our own ſelues, that <hi>the Lord heareth the poore when they cry vnto him, and ſaueth them out of all their troubles.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7.</note> So <hi>Dauid</hi> beſides this knowledge out of the word,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37.</note> that <hi>the Angell of the Lord pitcheth round about them that feare him, and deliuereth them,</hi> had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the truth of it by his owne experience in his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of the paw of the Lyon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18.</note> and out of the paw of the Beare, and thereupon was bold to encounter that great Goliah, that vncircumciſed Philiſtim. Againe, we know that <hi>the gates of hell</hi> ſhal not preuaile againſt Chriſt his Church, becauſe the ſcripture ſaith ſo. But will wee ſo know it to be ſo as if our owne ſenſes ſhould tell vs that it were ſo? Then we muſt obſerue the ſtormes and tempeſts, the perſecutions and troubles, the batteries and aſſaults, that Satan in his members makes againſt the Church, and how the Lord bringeth all their counſels to naught, and maketh their deuiſes to be nothing elſe but the imagination of a vaine thing. And thus in all things we muſt obſerue, that by long experience our ſpirituall ſenſes may be exerciſed to know the truth of euery thing that wee know out of the word. But ſo careleſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we are, that wee paſſe ouer the mercies and the iudgements of the Lord, without obſeruation at all, whereby we might grow in all iudgement and ſound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. It may be that ſome of vs ſometimes, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know ſomewhat out of the ſcriptures touching the Sacraments, touching the reſurrection, touching faith, touching good workes, &amp;c. But what is it? It is onely to know it there, it is not to haue a feeling of it in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:599:75"/> our owne ſoules. If wee haue the text of ſcripture for proofe, we thinke we haue knowledge enough, but for proofe out of our owne experience in our owne ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we look not after it. But beloued, ye ſee we ſhould haue a care, as to abound in knowledge out of the Scriptures, ſo in ſound iudgment out of a feeling experience in our ſelues of the truth of that we know. Let vs not therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ightly paſſe ouer the things that we know out of the word, but let vs labour to increaſe in a feeling knowledge of them in our owne ſoules. Let vs obſerue in our daily experience, that as it is written, ſo it is indeed, that when we heare or read ſuch and ſuch things out of the word, our owne ſoules within vs may giue witneſſe vnto the ſame, and ſay, it is ſo indeede, in mine owne experience I finde it to be moſt true. Thus the Apoſtle exhorteth, and thus it behoueth vs to doe.</p>
                  <p>The next thing which here I note, is that the Apoſtle praieth for the <hi>Philippians, that their loue may abound more and more in knowledge, and in all iudgement,</hi> which is, that their loue might bee founded and grounded in ſound knowledge, and in ſound iudgement, that each hauing helpe of other, and each being furniſhed by other, they might the better <hi>diſcerne things that differ &amp;c.</hi> Whence I obſerue yet a farther continuall care neceſſarie for all Chriſtians, and that is, <hi>that their loue may abound in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in all iudgement. Though</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I had all knowledge, and had not loue I were nothing.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2.</note> So on the other ſide, though we ſay we haue all loue, and haue not knowledge, it is nothing. for what is all our loue if it be not grounded in knowledge, and in iudgement? Then theſe are good when they grow vp together, and each hath helpe of other, and which of theſe ſoeuer growes vp without other, like vnto <hi>Ionas</hi> gourd, it will quickly wither. Our care then muſt be that our loue may abound in knowledge, and in all iudgement. In <hi>knowledge,</hi> that we may know on whom our loue ought principally to be ſet. And <hi>in all iudgement,</hi> that knowing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:599:76"/> whom we ought to loue, we may loue them whom wee ought,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.</note> and as we ought. <hi>Let vs doe good,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>vnto all men, but eſpecially vnto them which are of the houſholde of faith.</hi> Here we are taught whome we ought principally to loue. We are to loue all men, <hi>but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly them that are of the houſhold of faith,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are ioyned vnto vs in the band of Chriſtianity. And knowing that they are thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ought principally to loue we are to loue them in deed &amp; in truth, &amp; the more neerely that they are linked vnto vs in the bands of Chriſtianitie, the more dearely we are to loue them. Otherwiſe our loue, <hi>If it be not in knowledge, and in all iudgement,</hi> may do more harme then good, euen as wee ſee that zeale doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge; for it was in zeale, but without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18.</note> where hee ſaid, <hi>It is a good thing alwaies to loue earneſtly in a good thing.</hi> That they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and loued earneſtly he miſliked it not, nay, <hi>It is a good thing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to loue earneſtly.</hi> But that their loue was not in knowledge and iudgment, that he miſliked.

This he miſliked, and therefore tolde them, that <hi>it was a good thing to loue earneſtly alwaies in a good thing.</hi> We muſt loue, but wee muſt know that the thing we loue is good, that the perſon whome we loue is good. And therefore our loue muſt abound in knowledge, and in iudgement.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:599:76"/>
                  <p>This then ſerueth to condemne our great careleſneſſe in making choiſe on whome wee ſet our loue, and vnto whom we doe good, and performe duties of loue. Our loue ſhould abound in knowledge out of Gods word, whom to loue; and in iudgement to performe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue, to whome wee ought. But commonly wee care not where we caſt our loue, but as he fits our humor, ſo commonly wee caſt our loue vpon him. If hee will bowze and drinke with vs, if he will game and play with vs, if he will curſe and ſweare with vs, if he will play the good fellow, and runne to the diuell with vs, then wee will loue him, and what wee can wee will doe for him. Neither can it bee that they ſhould beſtowe their loues better, who themſelues are no better. Nay, where better graces are, yet is there no better choyce of our loue. We commonly looke rather how he ſutes our affections and likings, whom we would loue and fancie, then how he is beautified with the graces of Gods ſpirit, how well he is grounded and ſtabliſhed in the faith. And howſoeuer he be ſcarce ſound in the faith, yet if he ſute our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; likings, we grow to more entire loue w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> him then with others, more to beloued. If this, beloued, haue beene a fault in any of vs, let vs learne hereafter to reforme it, and <hi>let our loue abound more and more in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in iudgement.</hi> Let vs know out of the word whom we ought to loue, and vnto whome wee ought to doe good, and let vs loue them and do good vnto them. Let neither our knowledge bee without loue, nor our iudgement without loue, neither let our loue be without knowledge, or iudgement. Let vs abound more and more in loue, and in knowledge, and in iudgement; and let our loue abound more and more in knowledge, and in all iudgement.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That yee may diſcerne, &amp;c.]</hi> The firſt end wherefore the Apoſtle prayed for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they might <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more and more in knowledge, and in all iudgement,</hi> was, that they might diſcerne things that differ one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; that is, by their knowledge out of the word, and by their iudgement out of their owne experience, they might diſcerne betweene good and euill, vertue and vice, falſe and true Apoſtles, corrupt and vncorrupt doctrine, and ſo might follow the good, and fly the bad. The ſame phraſe of ſpeech that is heere vſed, is alſo vſed in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> though not ſo tranſlated in our Engliſh Bibles there,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.18.</note> as here. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle there, <hi>thou art called a Iewe, and reſteſt in the law, and gloriest in God, and knoweſt his will, and alloweſt the things that are excellent:</hi> Thus it is there tranſlated and read; as alſo ſome tranſlate the phraſe here in this place,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:599:77"/> reading thus, <hi>That ye may allow the things that are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi> But in that place to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the reading in the Margent is better then the reading in the Text, and is all one with the reading here vſed in this place of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; howbeit, the matter is not great whether reading we admit, both comming much to one: for whether wee reade thus, <hi>That yee may diſcerne things that differ,</hi> the meaning is, that vpon triall they might allow the things that are excellent: or thus, <hi>That ye may allow the things that are excellent,</hi> the meaning is, that vpon the diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of things that differ, they may allow the things that are excellent. But I follow the reading, as in this place we haue it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing then which heere I note is, the end wherefore the Apoſtle prayed for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that <hi>they might abound in knowledge, and in all iudgement,</hi> and it was, that they might trie and diſcerne things that diffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, right from wrong, truth from error, religion from ſuperſtition, &amp;c. that being able to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, they might allow and follow that which were good, that which they ought. Whence I obſerue the end wherefore all Chriſtians ought to labour for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in knowledge, and in all iudgement, and that is, that they may diſcerne things that differ, good from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, right from wrong, truth from error, religion from ſuperſtition, &amp;c. that ſo they may be pure and without offence, vntill the day of Chriſt, &amp;c. For, therefore are we to follow after knowledge, that we may know what is good and what is euill, what is truth and what is error, and may be able to trie the ſpirits, and to put a difference between things that differ one from another: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we to labour after a ſound iudgement, through a feeling experience in our owne ſoules, of the truth of thoſe things which wee are taught out of the word, that hauing our wits exerciſed to diſcerne both good and euil. we may be pure, and without offence, &amp;c. This place of our Apoſtle is proofe pregnant enough to this purpoſe;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:599:78"/> where yee ſee that the Apoſtle in his loue toward the <hi>Philippians</hi> praied for them <hi>that they might abound in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and in all iudgement,</hi> to this end, <hi>that they might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne &amp;c.</hi> And wherefore is it that now we the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpoſers of Gods ſecrets doe preach vnto you the Goſpell of your ſaluation, and labor amongſt you that yee may be rich in all knowledge, and in all iudgement? Is it not to this end, that ye may be taught in the waies of God, that yee may be able to try the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which is the ſpirit of truth, and which is the ſpirit of error, that yee may be able to put a difference betweene good and euill, that yee may be pure in doctrine, in life, and in manners, that yee may be without offence vntill the day of Chriſt? Yes, beloued, therefore we labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you and admoniſh you, therefore wee ſhew you the whole counſell of God, therefore as much as we can we helpe forward your knowledge, therefore wee call vpon you to obſerue in your owne experience the truth of thoſe things which yee know out of the word; yea therfore as the Apoſtle, we pray <hi>that your loue may abound in knowledge, and in all iudgement,</hi> that in this dotage of the world, wherein there are ſo many ſpirits of error, ſo many that walke not as they ought, becauſe they erre in their hearts, yee may be able to try the ſpirits, whether they be of God, that yee be not deceiued by them, that yee may be able to put a difference betweene things that differ one from another; that ye may flie the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in the world and be pure; that ye may hold a right courſe, and be without offence; that ye may denie vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and be filled with the fruits of righteouſnes &amp;c. And if for theſe ends we thus doe, then for theſe ends alſo yee ought euen all of you, all that heare vs, to labour for increaſe in knowledge and in all iudgement. Reading, hearing, meditating, praying, euery holy courſe ye ought to vſe, that ye may increaſe and abound in knowledge and in all iudgment, to this end, that in ſuch ignorance ye may be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:599:78"/> things that differ, that in ſuch corruption ye may be pure, that in ſuch declination ye may be without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnti l the day of Chriſt, and that in ſuch wallowing in vnrighteouſnes ye may be filled with the fruits &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Very iuſtly then are they hence to be reproued, that in ſeeking after knowledge euen out of the ſcriptures, propoſe rather any other end which they ſhould not, then theſe which they ſhould. For of thoſe that doe vouchſafe to ſearch the ſcriptures, many there are whoſe end is to peruert the ſcriptures, thence to build the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their owne braine, and to beguile vnſtable ſoules. Such are they that ſeeing the chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſt to leane vpon the ſcriptures, do by their corruptions of the text, their corrupt gloſſes vpon the text, their falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from the text labour to ouerthrow the truth, and to build their owne errors. Others there are, whoſe end in ſeeking knowledge out of the ſcriptures is onely a vaine oſtentation, that men may thinke and ſpeake of them as great Rabbins, good expounders of the law, and very skilfull in the ſcriptures. Such are they of whoſe knowledge the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, when hee ſaith, that <hi>knowledge puffeth vp:</hi> for as they regarded nothing in ſeeking after knowledge but a vaine oſtentation,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.</note> ſo hauing atteined vnto knowledge they ſwell and looke ſo bigg as if all knowledge were ſhut vp in their breaſts. Others there are whoſe end is, to informe their owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that they may not be ignorant in the law of their God, but may know the ſtorie of the Bible, the courſe and meaning of the ſcriptures. Such are they that delight themſelues onely with the knowledge of the myſteries of God, but ſhew not any fruits of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in a ſober, honeſt, and godly life. Indeede men generally in ſeeking knowledge, out of the ſcriptures ayme rather at euery other end, then at that whereat they ſhould. But wee, beloued, may not be like vnto them. Here yee ſee wherefore we ſhould labour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more and more in knowledge, and in all iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:599:79"/> Whatſoeuer others doe, let this be our direction what we are to doe. And though the ſmalleſt number by farre make the bent of their increaſe in knowledge the informing of their vnderſtandings, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their liues, yet let vs ſet in with this little num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and let this end ſtirre vp our deſires to increaſe in knowledge. Let vs labour, and let vs pray that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more and more in knowledge and in all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen therefore that <hi>we may diſcerne &amp;c.</hi> Let vs know that our increaſe in knowledge is nothing, if it be not for theſe ends, and let the deſire of theſe ends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our thirſting after knowledge.</p>
                  <p>My next note is from the things themſelues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle praied, <hi>that they might abound more and more in knowledge, and in all iudgement.</hi> Whereof the firſt was, <hi>that they might diſcerne things that differed</hi> one from another, that being able to ſee the difference of things concerning either doctrine, life, or manners, they might in each flie that which were euill, and follow that which were good. Whence I obſerue an imployment neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and behouefull for all Chriſtians, namely, that <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their wits exerciſed through long cuſtome, they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne good and euill,</hi> that ſeeing the difference betweene things, in all kinde of things they may chuſe the good, and refuſe the bad.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.21. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Try all things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and keepe that which is good.</hi> The word there vſed is the ſame with this in this place of our Apoſtle, and it ſignifieth to try, to ſifte, to examine; and that which is here ſpoken vnto the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> is ſpoken in them vnto all the faithfull children of God. What is then the meaning of the Apoſtle in theſe words? This yee muſt know that then there were, as ſtill there are, peſtilent and deceiuing ſpirits, which trouble the Church, and corrupt, or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the doctrine of the Goſpell. And this alſo yee muſt know, that then there were, as ſtill there are ſome, which becauſe of ſuch men wilfully reiect the doctrine of the Goſpell, and others which fooliſhly beleeue euery ſpirit
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:599:79"/> that ſpeaketh in the name of Chriſt. The Apoſtle ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willeth them, and in them vs, neither wilfully to reiect euery thing, becauſe of ſome wicked men; nor yet fooliſhly to admit euery thing that is ſpoken in the name of Chriſt, but to try, and ſift, and examine all things by the rule of the word. And what then? when by tryall we ſee and diſcerne things that differ one from another, he willeth vs to <hi>keepe that which is good;</hi> for that is the end wherefore we are to try things. So that hence we ſee that it is an imployment very behouefull for vs all, that we may be able to diſcerne things that differ one from another, that ſeeing the difference of things wee may imbrace that which is good, &amp; auoide the contrary. The ſame alſo we may ſee by the Holy Ghoſts commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the men of <hi>Beraea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.</note> for <hi>ſearching the Scriptures to ſee whether the things that were ſpoken were ſo.</hi> It was <hi>Paul</hi> that preached vnto them, and when he preached vnto them, they turned their books, and lookt diligently into the ſcriptures to ſee whether in any thing he diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the doctrine of the Holy Ghoſt. And this is regiſtred both for their commendation, and our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to admoniſh vs that we are to care that we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne things that differ either in doctrine from corrupt doctrine, or in faith from ſound, or in manners from a Chriſtian and holy conuerſation. And why? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is very plaine:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20.</note> euen that we <hi>be not like to the beaſts that periſh,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh of a <hi>man that is in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and hath no vnderſtanding.</hi> For what will yee thinke of ſuch a man that cannot diſcerne betweene chaffe and wheat, droſſe and gold, ſowre and ſweet? Will yee not ſay that he is like to the beaſt that periſheth? What then muſt yee needs ſay and thinke of that Chriſtian that can not diſcerne betweene truth and error, religion and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, vertue and vice, good and euill? Any better? Nay ſurely: for theſe are as wheat &amp; chaff, gold &amp; droſſe, and not to diſcerne betweene them is not to diſcerne between wheat and chaffe, gold and droſſe. If then we
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:599:80"/> will not be like vnto the beaſts that periſh, our care muſt be that out of our knowledge in the Scriptures we may be able <hi>to diſcerne things that differ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But doe we thus imploy our care? Nay thus farre I haue onely ſaid what we ſhould doe: but what we doe, our vnableneſſe to diſcerne betweene things that differ one from another too too plainly diſcouer. For what is the cauſe why ſo quickly wee hearken vnto thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers that compaſſe ſea and land to make one of their profeſſion, and when he is made they make him twofold more the childe of hell then they themſelues are? Why we are ſo eaſily ſeduced to beleeue the ſpirits of error, and to fall from our owne ſtedfaſtnes? Is it not euen hence becauſe we cannot diſcerne things that differ one from another? They bring vnto vs the fancies of their owne braine, the traditions of their owne Church, lies out of their owne Legends, and we receiue them becauſe wee cannot diſcerne them from the truth of Chriſt Ieſus. They come vnto vs in the name of Chriſt Ieſus, but bring with them the doctrine of Deuils forbidding to marrie, and commanding to abſteine from meats which God hath created to be receiued with thankſgiuing, and we beleeue them, becauſe we cannot try the ſpirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God, to ſee which is the ſpirit of truth, and which is the ſpirit of error. For God forbid that I ſhould thinke that if we could diſcerne betweene truth and error, religion and ſuperſtition, any of vs would follow their damnable hereſies, by whom the way of truth is euill ſpoken of. Againe, what is the cauſe why we are often deceiued with the ſhadowes of good things, with the ſemblances of things honeſt, and iuſt, and pure, with the dimme ſhewes of vertue, and praiſe, and holines of life? Is it not euen hence, becauſe we cannot diſcerne things that differ one from another? Oftentimes we thinke we runne well, when we runne quite a wrong courſe; oftentimes we count that our praiſe, which is indeed our diſpraiſe; and a great many of vs thinke that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:599:80"/> 
                     <hi>we haue Abraham to our father,</hi> when indeed we are of our father the deuill. And all hence (as I thinke) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot diſcerne things that differ.</p>
                  <p>And yet, tell a great many of vs that we know not good from euill, that we cannot diſcerne between truth and error, right and wrong, &amp;c. we cannot brooke it, but we diſdaine to be counted ſo ſimple and ignorant that we cannot diſcerne things ſo different. But let me but aske theſe queſtions. How is it that ſo commonly we fly that which is good, and follow that which is euill? How is it that ſo eaſily we are drawen oftentimes from the way of truth into error? How is it that vice vnder the colour of vertue, ſo often doth deceiue vs? Is it not becauſe we cannot diſcerne good from euill, truth from error, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from vice? Either it is ſo, or worſe, for either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly we erre, as not able to diſcerne betweene things that differ, or wilfully we runne a wrong courſe, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning well enough things that differ, but wilfully run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſelues on the rockes. Beloued, let vs thinke of theſe things, and let vs be aſhamed of it, that we cannot diſcerne betweene things that differ one from other. It is enough for vs that we haue ſpent the time paſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly and fooliſhly. Let vs henceforth redeeme the time, and learne to diſcerne things that differ. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the time that we haue ſpent in the ſchoole of Chriſt, we may well thinke that now we ſhould haue ſo much knowledge as to diſcerne things that differ one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And if truth and error, good and euill, &amp;c. be vnto vs (as yet) as colours vnto blinde men, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne betweene them, we may well thinke that we are blinde. Let vs therefore go vnto Chriſt Ieſus in his word that we may receaue ſight, and ſee clearely. Let vs reade, and heare, and meditate in the holy word of God, that thence we may know what <hi>is good and acceptable vnto God.</hi> Let vs pray, and labour by all holy meanes that we may <hi>abound in knowledge, and in all iudgement,</hi> that we may diſcerne things that differ one from another.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond thing wherefore the Apoſtle prayed that the <hi>Philippians might abound more and more in knowledge, and in all iudgement,</hi> was, that they might be pure, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">

And why? for Chriſt our paſſeouer is ſacrificed for vs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtle implieth thus much, that as the Iewes in the celebration of the feaſt of the paſſeouer were to put away for all that time all leauen out of their houſes, and onely to eat vnleauened bread; ſo we, now that Chriſt our paſſeouer is ſacrificed for vs, are to purge our ſelues, and to clenſe the houſes of our bodies from all leauen, and filthines, &amp; corruption, &amp; to keep the feaſt with the vnleauened bread of ſinceritie, and truth, holineſſe and godlineſſe, ſo that for the whole time of the feaſt, the whole terme of our life, there be no leauen, no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all found in the houſes of our bodies. Can any thing be more plaine for that puritie which ought to be in vs? Much to the like purpoſe is that of our bleſſed Sauiour to his Diſciples, where he warneth them, ſaying, <hi>Take heede and beware of the leauen of the Phariſes and Sadduces.</hi> In which words he warneth them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.12.</note> and in them vs, to look vnto it, that we be pure from all corruption in doctrine. And in that he doubleth the caueat, ſaying, <hi>Take heede, and beware,</hi> he ſheweth how very behouefull it is to looke vnto it: and in that he calleth corruption in doctrine <hi>leauen,</hi> he ſheweth both the poyſon of it that it marres the whole man, as a little leauen that leaueneth the whole lumpe, and likewiſe the riddance that ſhould be of it out of the houſes of our bodies, as of leauen out
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:599:82"/> of the houſes in the feaſt of the paſſeouer. So that yee ſee how behouefull an imployment for vs it is that we be pure from all corruption in doctrine, life, and manners. And the reaſon is plaine: for what fellowſhip hath truth with error? or what communion hath good with euill? We cannot ſerue both God and Mammon: wee muſt flie that which is euill, and follow that which is good. Halting betweene God and Ball will not ſerue; we muſt <hi>worſhip the Lord our God, and him onely muſt we ſerue.</hi> If we be circumciſed Chriſt ſhall profit vs nothing: if there be any mixture of corruption in vs, our religion is in vaine. It is but the one of two; either pure, or impure. If we will not be impure, our care muſt be to be pure.</p>
                  <p>Here then are met withall ſuch tollerations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, as either in policie, or vpon any carnal reaſon, we are wont to take and allow vnto our ſelues. Whereas the Apoſt. would haue vs purged of all corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we will allow ſome mixture of corruption, and all things ſhall be well notwithſtanding. Againe, we like not of thoſe hot headed fellowes, that preciſely vrge a conformitie in all things, according vnto the word, we cannot away with thoſe pure men, that would haue vs ſo pure, that we ſhould not ſpeake a word amiſſe, or doe any thing that is euill: We are men, and we muſt play the goodfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes now and then, we muſt ſweare now and then, we muſt runne at ryot now and then, we muſt drinke, and daunce, and play now and then more then wee ſhould, wee muſt paſſe the bounds of modeſtie, honeſtie, and Chriſtian dutie, now and then. And if ſome of vs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily will not breake out into ſuch termes, yet wee will thinke that ſometimes wee may aduenture a little vpon ſome breach of the law, that we may without great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence commit ſuch and ſuch little ſinnes, that a little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, a little yeelding vnto the faſhions of the world, cannot doe ſo much harme, that too much ſtrictneſſe and preciſeneſſe is naught; and that to ſtand ſo much v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon purity and ſincerity, is but to make our ſelues the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:599:82"/> talke, and mocke, and by-word of the people. Thus we will be moderaters ouer the holy Ghoſt, and when hee ſeemes vnto vs to ouer-reach, wee will bring him to the meaſure of our owne ſcantling.</p>
                  <p>But beloued, let vs not deceaue our ſelues, God is not mocked, but what he requireth of vs, it ſtandeth vs vpon to take care of the performance of it. The end of our calling is, that we be holy in all manner of conuerſation, as he which hath called vs is holy. And therefore hath God choſen vs in Chriſt Ieſus, before the foundation of the world, that wee ſhould bee holy, and without blame before him in loue. And Chriſt our Paſſeouer is once, and for euer ſacrificed for vs, that henceforth we ſhould keepe the Feaſt of the Paſſeouer vnto the Lord for euer; ſo that now no leauen of corruption at all may be found in all our houſes. Let vs therefore take heede how wee make tollerations and indulgences vnto our ſelues. Let vs take heed how we ſuffer any leauen of corruption in the houſes of our bodies: and let vs rather purge out the olde leauen, that we may be a new lumpe. Let vs ſtriue as much as poſſibly we can, after this purity that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs; and let vs aſſure our ſelues, that when we haue ſtriuen all that euer we can, after this purity wee ſhall bee impure enough, and too much. We ſee what it is that is required of vs, as therefore the Apoſtle willeth <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.</note> Let vs keepe our ſelues pure, pure from corruption in doctrine and pure from corruption in life and manners, that as our Apoſtle afterwards exhorteth, we may bee blameleſſe and pure, and the ſonnes of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke in the middeſt of a naughty and crooked nation. Let our care bee firſt to diſcerne things that differ, that wee may skill what is pure, what not, either in doctrine, life, or manners; and then knowing that, let vs care and ſtudie to be pure, and ſincere, and without all leauen of corruption, either in doctrine, life, or manners.</p>
                  <p>The third thing wherefore the Apoſtle prayed that the <hi>Philippians</hi> might abound more and more in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:599:83"/> and in all iudgement was, that they might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, .1. that they might not ſtumble at any thing, but hold on in a conſtant courſe without ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or ſlipping ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ke, or ſtanding at a ſtay, vntill the day of Chriſt, when their conſtant perſeuerance ſhould be rewarded. For the Apoſtles deſire was, 1. that they <hi>might be able to diſcerne things that differed,</hi> what were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and bad, and what were pure and good. 2. That being able to diſcerne and try all things, they might keep that which were good, and might be pure from all leauen of corruption. 3. That being pure from all leauen of corruption, they might keepe a conſtant courſe in their puritie without ſtumbling, or ſhrinking backe, or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at a ſtay, and for theſe cauſes he praied <hi>that they might abound more and more in knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> &amp;c.</hi> Whence I obſerue a third imployment very behouefull for all Chriſtians, namely that being in a good courſe they hold on without ſtumbling, or ſtanding, or ſhrinking, being pure and cleare from all leauen of corruption, they keep themſelues ſo vntill the day of Chriſt. <hi>Are yee ſo fooliſh,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galathians) that after yee haue begun in the ſpirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3.</note> 
                     <hi>yee would now be made perfit by the fleſh.</hi> The <hi>Galathians</hi> had embraced the Goſpell, and obeyed the truth: but now through certaine falſe Apoſtles they had fallen from the pure doctrine of Chriſt, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome corruptions of that doctrine. And therefore the Apoſtle reproues them ſharply, and tells them that it is no courſe for a Chriſtian to begin in the ſpirit, and to end in the fleſh, but hauing begun in the ſpirit by embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the pure doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, they ſhould end in the ſpirit, and hold faſt that pure doctrine which they had embraced, euen vntill the day of Chriſt. So that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obeyed the truth, we are not to yeeld to any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the truth, or to let our hold ſlip, but to hold faſt the ſame vnto the end. It is for the dogge to returne to his owne vomit, and for the ſowe that was waſhed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to her wallowing in the mire; but the man that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:599:83"/> hauing <hi>put his hand to the plough looketh backe,</hi>

                     <hi>he is not apt to the kingdome of God.</hi> Being in a good way, wee muſt with our Apoſtle ſtill endeuour to <hi>that which is before, and follow hard toward the marke for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> But I haue lately ſpoken to this purpoſe, and therefore now the time being paſt I will not farther trouble you.

The materiall cauſe, or matter and ſubſtance of good works is hereby known that they are called <hi>the fruits of righteouſneſſe:</hi> for this ſheweth that the very matter and ſubſtance of good works is thoſe good actions which as good fruit grow and ſpring out of the righteouſnes of God in vs. The formall cauſe, or reaſon which cauſeth our works to be good works, is hereby likewiſe knowne that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the fruits of righteouſneſſe:</hi> for this ſheweth that the reaſon why our works are good works, is becauſe of their conformitie vnto the law of God, becauſe they are done in righteouſnes according to the righteous law of God. The efficient cauſe, or author from whom good works are is hereby knowne, that it is ſaid that they are <hi>by Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> for this ſheweth that Ieſus Chriſt worketh in vs whatſoeuer works are good &amp; agreeable to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous law of God. The finall cauſe, or end of good works wherunto they are to be referred, wherfore they are to be done is hereby knowne, that it is ſaid that they are <hi>by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt vnto the glory and praiſe of God:</hi> for this ſheweth that the end wherefore we are to abound in euery good worke, is the glory and praiſe of God, that his name thereby may be glorified. Theſe are the things which theſe words ſeeme vnto me to conteine. Now let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence for our farther vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing then which here I note, is the rich grace wherewith our Apoſtle would haue the <hi>Philippians</hi> to abound, in good works: for he praied <hi>that they might abound more and more in knowledge and in all iudgement,</hi> as for other ends before ſpoken of, ſo for this, that they might be filled with the fruits of righteouſnes, that they might abound in euery good worke. My obſeruation hence is, that we are not onely to doe the things that are
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:599:84"/> good, and to worke the works of righteouſnes, but we are to abound in euery good worke, to be filled with the fruits of righteouſnes. To doe good, and to haue our fruit in holines and righteouſnes, is a thing much vrged, and often commanded by the Holy Ghoſt in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, and it is ſo cleare a caſe that it cannot be denied or ſhifted, but that we are to do the things that are good, &amp; to worke the works of righteouſnes. Yet ſo cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning are we to deceiue our ſelues, that if at ſometimes we haue done ſome things well, we thinke we haue obeyed the voice of the Lord herein, though we come far ſhort of being filled w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the fruits of righteouſnes. The Holy Ghoſt therfore to meet with our fooliſh wiſdom, and to cleare the point, plainely ſheweth in many places of the ſcripture, that as wee are to ſhew forth good works, ſo we are to be rich in good works; as we are to liue righteouſly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, ſo we are to be filled with the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, that in our whole ſpirit, ſoule, and body through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our whole life, the fruits thereof may appeare. <hi>We ceaſe not to pray for you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi>

                  <p>Here then firſt beloued take a caueat, to beware of them that tell you that we make no reckoning of good works, that all our preaching is of an idle and dead faith, that we are afraid in our Sermons to make any mention of good works, and that when we mention them, either we condemne them, or ſpeake ſo coldly of them, as if there were no worth at all in them. Let your owne eares witneſſe what we preach vnto you, and whether they do not moſt vntruly ſlander vs that thus ſpeake of vs. What more doe we beat vpon and vrge then that yee may be pure, that ye may be without offence vntill the day of Chriſt, that yee may be filled with the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and abound in euery good worke? Anſwere them therfore out of your owne knowledg, &amp; tell them that <hi>they are of their father the deuill, who is a lier, and the father thereof.</hi> Yee your ſelues know it, and therefore may boldly ſpeake it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this be as a ſpurre to pricke vs forward, and to ſtirre vs vp to euery good worke. For ſhould we
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:599:86"/> be filled with the fruits of righteouſnes, and abound in euery good worke? How is it then that we are ſo barren in good works, like vnto the heath in the wildernes that bringeth forth no fruit that is good. Abound in works we doe, but it is in the ſinfull works of the fleſh, not in good works of the ſpirit: and full of fruits we are, but it is of the fruits of vnrighteouſnes, maliciouſnes, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, oppreſſion, and the like, not full of the fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes. If there be here and there a cluſter of grapes, as in the gathering after the vintage, if wee doe ſome things well, though they be nothing in compariſon of the euill that we doe, if after we haue runne at ryot a long time, at length we haue ſome fruit in holineſſe, if in the moderation and gouernment of our affections and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we doe more ſauour of the ſpirit then in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of the world men doe, then we thinke well of our good works, and count our ſelues ſuch as haue well profited in the ſchoole of Chriſt. But to vrge vs to be filled with the fruits of righteouſnes, to be fruitfull in all good works, to haue our whole conuerſation holy, to ſhew forth the fruits of the ſpirit, in our whole ſpirit, ſoule, and bodie throughout our whole life, this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brooke, and this is a thing wherein the Preacher may well ſtriue with vs, but wherein he ſhall not preuaile with vs. For here it is with vs, as it was with the yong man in the Goſpell, who ſoothed vp himſelfe as if hee had beene as good a man as liued, till it was ſaid vnto him,<note place="margin">

Some one <hi>Tabitha,</hi> it may be may be full of good works, but with the reſt it is well if they be not as bad as the worſt. Let vs beloued now that we know what we ſhould be, ſtriue vnto that which ſhould be. Let vs as we ſhould be, be trees of righteouſnes, filled with the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. As as we are purged by Chriſt Ieſus to be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people vnto him, zealous of good works; ſo let vs abound in euery good worke. Let vs not onely flie that is euill, and doe that is good, but as men ſanctified throughout in ſpirit, ſoule, and bodie, let our whole life and conuerſation be ſuch, as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. The more fruit we beare, the better trees we are; the more by our fruits we glorifie God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the more ſure we are that we are branches of the true vine Chriſt Ieſus. Let vs therefore giue all diligence, vſe all holy meanes, and pray that we may abound more and more in the knowledge of Gods will, that we may diſcerne things that differ, that we may be pure, and without offence vntill the day of Chriſt, filled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe, and being fruitfull in all good works.</p>
                  <p>The next thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle calleth good works, <hi>the fruits of righteouſnes.</hi> For it is as if he had ſaid, filled with good works which are the fruits of righteouſnes, therefore called the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, becauſe they ſpring from righteouſnes, as the fruit from the tree. The obſeruation then hence is, that good works are the fruits of righteouſnes. Righteouſnes that is the tree, and good works they are the fruit of the tree; ſo that as firſt muſt be the tree, and then the fruit; ſo firſt we muſt be righteous, euen by the righteouſnes of God in vs, before we can doe the works that are good. Now
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:599:87"/> what is our righteouſnes before God? Our Apoſtle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs in the third chapter of this epiſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>verſ</hi> 9.</note> euen that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is through the faith of Chriſt; for as <hi>Abraham beleeued God, &amp; it was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes</hi> ſo our faith in Chriſt Ieſus <hi>who is made of God vnto vs wiſdome, and righteouſnes, and ſanctification, and redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> is accounted vnto vs for righteouſnes before God. Firſt then we muſt beleeue in Chriſt Ieſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloud, before we can doe any works acceptable vnto God; and being iuſtified by faith in Chriſt, then are our works good and acceptable vnto God. And to this our Apoſtle giueth teſtimonie where he ſaith, <hi>Vnto the pure all things are pure,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>but vnto them that are defiled and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, is nothing pure, but euen their mindes and conſciences are defiled.</hi> In which words, by <hi>pure</hi> he meaneth them whoſe hearts are purified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, as the antitheſis in the next clauſe ſheweth, where he expreſſeth whom he meaneth by <hi>impure men,</hi> euen vnbeleuing men. Hence then it is plaine, that when once our hearts are purified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, not onely the things which by the law are counted vncleane are cleane and pure vnto vs, but our works alſo are good and holy; but till our hearts be purified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, neither any of the things which by the law are counted pure are pure vnto vs, neither is any worke of ours good, but how good ſoeuer it be in ſhew, yet it is indeed abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God. To the like purpoſe is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.6.</note> where he ſaith, that <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> where the Apoſtle ſhewing the dignitie and excellencie of faith, amongſt other things commendeth it for this, that by it, as <hi>Henoch</hi> did, we pleaſe God; but <hi>without faith,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is vnpoſſible that any worke of ours whatſoeuer ſhould pleaſe God.</hi> So that our works if they be good, they are the fruits of righteouſnes, euen of the righteouſnes which is of God, through the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, otherwiſe if they ſpring not from that roote they are not good.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:599:87"/>
                  <p>Here then, firſt learne to beware of them that tell you that our good workes, are that righteouſneſſe whereby we are iuſtified before God. Yee ſee the Apoſtle tel eth you, that they are the fruites of righteouſneſſe. Aſwell therefore may they tell you, that the fruite of tree is the tree, as that our good workes are our righteouſneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore God. <hi>Let God bee true, and euery man a lier.</hi> If hee haue ſaid, that they are the fruites of righteouſneſſe, then aſſure we our ſelues, that they are ſpirits of error that tell vs that they are our righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence learne to beware of them that tell you, that men not begotten in the faith of Chriſt Ieſus, are able to doe the things that are good and pleaſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; for either you muſt not belieue the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or rather the holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking by the mouth of the Apoſtle; or elſe you muſt know, that they onely do the things that are good and pleaſing vnto God, that are iuſtified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus: for this the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath ſaid, <hi>That good workes are the fruites of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> Either then our good workes muſt ſpring and proceed, from the righteouſnes of God by faith in Chriſt Ieſus in vs, or elſe they are not good: ſo that they onely that are iuſtified by faith in CHRIST IESVS, doe the things that are good. And therefore they that tell you otherwiſe, they are led by the ſame ſpirit of error tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they are who tell you, that by our workes we are iuſtified before God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let this teach vs how to examine our workes whether they be good or no. Are they the fruites of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe? Do they proceed from a true and liuely faith in Chriſt Ieſus? Is the fountaine pure whence they ſpring, and their end good whereunto they tend? Then bee bolde they are good workes. Otherwiſe, if there bee no ſuch warrant for them, ſeeme they neuer ſo good, yet they are not good. Examine but our works according to this rule, and ſurely we will not all of vs be found full of good workes.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:599:88"/>
                  <p>The third thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that theſe fruites of righteouſneſſe wherewith hee would haue the <hi>Philippians</hi> filled, are by Ieſus Chriſt. Whence I obſerue the Author of euery good worke in vs, and that is Chriſt Ieſus, by the grace of his holy ſpirit:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelues, to thinke any thing as of our ſelues, but our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> Now, if of our ſelues we be not ſufficient to thinke a good thought, but that muſt onely be ſuggeſted by Gods ſpirit, then how ſhall wee bee ſufficient of our ſelues to doe any thing that is good? Nay, our Apoſtle tels vs in the next Chapter,<note place="margin">13.</note> that <hi>it is God which workes in vs both the will and the deed, euen of his good pleaſure.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought of the heart, nor affection of the will, nor worke of the hand, but if it be good, it is by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy ſpirit in vs. Nay, take an argument euen from hence; Good workes they are the fruites of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Now doth the fruite of a tree bud or grow by the labour or skill of man. Nay, hee planteth and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but God onely giues the fruite in due ſeaſon. Right ſo it is not in man to doe that is good, but if he doe that is good, it is of God. Worke of himſelfe he may, and to worke that which is euill hee is too proane of himſelfe; but if he worke any thinke that is acceptable vnto God, it is wholly by the ſpirit of God. And why? That God may be all in all, and that he may haue the glorie of all.</p>
                  <p>Let this ſufficiently warne vs to beware of them, and arme vs againſt them, that would perſwade vs that wee are able of our ſelues to doe that is good, at leaſt if wee be holpen by grace. If wee thinke, or will, or doe any thing that is good, whatſoeuer fruite of righteouſneſſe it is that is in vs, it is by Ieſus Chriſt, not of our ſelues, for then we had wherein to reioyce in our ſelues, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his good pleaſure, that by his good ſpirit worketh it in vs. This our Apoſtle telleth vs, and this wee learne from him, and if any man preach vnto vs, or teach vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then this that wee haue receaued, let him bee accurſed.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:599:88"/>
                  <p>Secondly, let this teach, vs vnto whome all praiſe is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The laſt thing which here I note is, touching the end of good workes, which as they are by Ieſus Chriſt, as the author and worker of them in vs, ſo they are to be done to the glorie and praiſe of his name. Whence I obſerue, vnto what end our workes muſt be done if they be good, and that is vnto the glorie and praiſe of God. Ye know that of the Apoſtle, where hee ſaith, <hi>Whether yee eate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</note> 
                     <hi>or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glorie of God.</hi> As alſo that of our Sauiour, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie your father which is in heauen.</hi> And that of <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Haue your conuerſation honeſt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they which ſpeake euill of you, as of euill doers, may by your good workes which they ſhall ſee, glorifie God in the day of the viſitation.</hi> By which, and many other places which might be alleaged to this purpoſe, it appeareth, that the end whereunto our workes (if they bee good) muſt bee referred, muſt be the glorie and praiſe of God that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be glorified, both by vs, and by others which ſee our good workes.</p>
                  <p>Here then, firſt, we learne not to credite any that ſhall tell vs, that any action of any vnregenerate man can be good. For, what is the end of ſuch men in their actions? Is it the praiſe and glorie of God? Nay, it is their owne praiſe, and the praiſe of men which they ſeeke after, in all the moſt glorious things that they doe. But hence wee learne that ſo our workes are good works, if they be by Ieſus Chriſt, vnto the glorie and praiſe of God.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:599:89"/>
                  <p>Secondly, hence we learne, that the end of our good workes is not to be, that thereby we may merite heauen but that thereby God may bee glorified. Nay, if our workes bee thereby to merite heauen, they cannot be to the glorie and praiſe of God. For how much ſo euer is giuen to merite, ſo much is taken from the glorie of God. Either therefore we muſt renounce all merite, or elſe whatſoeuer we ſay, our workes are not to the glorie of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this teacheth vs, whatſoeuer we doe, to do it to the honour and praiſe of God. Let this therefore bee our end in all that euer wee doe, that thereby God may be glorified: and let vs know that, ſo onely, that which we doe is good, if we do it to this end.</p>

                     <hi>I would yee vnderſtood, brethren, that the things which haue come vnto me]</hi> What were thoſe? Euen all thoſe things which befell him in his ſayling towards <hi>Rome,</hi> at his firſt going thither from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but eſpecially his bands in his firſt impriſonment at <hi>Rome.</hi> For this yee muſt vnderſtand, that <hi>Paul</hi> was twiſe priſoner at <hi>Rome:</hi> once in the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi> his reigne, about the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare of his reigne; and againe in the latter end of his reigne, about the thirteenth yeare of his reigne. For when being at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> he was put from <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> vnto <hi>Felix,</hi> and againe from <hi>Felix</hi> vnto <hi>Feſtus,</hi> and ſtill the Iewes hunted after his bloud, at length he was conſtreined to appeale vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> vnto the Emperor
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:599:90"/> of <hi>Rome,</hi> then <hi>Nero.</hi> Whereupon he was ſent thither, and after many perills and dangers eſcaped by the ſea, he came to Rome, where he was priſoner two yeares at the leaſt, <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifying ſo much. At which time hee wrote diuers Epiſtles vnto the Churches, which he had planted in the Eaſt, as vnto the <hi>Galathians,</hi> vnto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> vnto the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> vnto the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> as ſome thinke, and this vnto the <hi>Philippians.</hi> But as the Apoſtle hoped that the Lord would, as we read in the next chapter; ſo at this time he did deliuer him from the mouth of that lyon <hi>Nero,</hi> both he being leſſe cruell now then afterwards he grew to be, and the Lord hauing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined that by him many of the Gentiles ſhould heare the Goſpell, vnto whom it had not as yet been preached. This, as I ſaid, was about the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi> his reigne. Againe, about the latter end of his reigne he was caſt into priſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> and then he was indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by that lyon,<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi>
                     </note> ſlaine by that cruell tyrant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor <hi>Nero.</hi> Whatſoeuer then in this Epiſtle is ſpoken of the Apoſtles bands, yee muſt vnderſtand it meant of his firſt impriſonment at <hi>Rome.</hi> By the things then which came vnto him in this place, we muſt vnderſtand his bands in his firſt impriſonment at <hi>Rome.</hi> Now what of theſe? Theſe (ſaith the Apoſtle) are turned rather to the furthering of the Goſpell, then to the hindering of it, contrary to the hope of the aduerſaries of the Goſpell, which did caſt him into priſon: for they hoped, that his bands would preuaile much to hinder the courſe of the Goſpell; but he tells the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that the Lord had turned them rather to the fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For ſo his bands in Chriſt, .i. which he ſuſteined for Chriſt his ſake and the Goſpels, were famous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the iudgement hall, .i. throughout all the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Court, and in all other places both of the Citie, and of other Countries.

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:599:94"/> Goſpell came to be knowne, and to be beleeued by many in all theſe places. This was the firſt fruit of his bands, by them the Goſpell was farre diſperſed. Againe, through his bands and conſtancie therein, many of the brethren in the Lord, many Paſtors and Teachers of the Church, were emboldened more frankly and freely to ſpeake the word, .i. to profeſſe and preach the Goſpell, then before they durſt. And this was the ſecond fruit and effect of his bands, by them the Teachers of the word tooke courage, to ſpeake the word more boldly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had done. Plaine therefore it was that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the hope of the aduerſaries of the Goſpell, his bands were turned rather to the furthering, then to the hindering of the Goſpell, inaſmuch as by occaſion of his bands both the Goſpell was farther ſpred and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then before, and likewiſe the Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell more incouraged and emboldned to preach the Goſpell then before. Thus much of the ſenſe of the words. Now to the obſeruations.</p>
                  <p>Here might be noted the Apoſtles carefulnes to take away the ſcandall and offence of his bands, wherewith the <hi>Philippians</hi> might happily bee troubled, and thereat take offence. And thence might bee obſerued the care which Paſtors ought to haue, of taking away whatſoeuer may breed any doubt, or occaſion, any offence amongſt their people. The neglect of which care doth often ſo much harme, that their ſilence in the Church were as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, as their careleſneſſe to remooue all ſcruples and occaſions of offence from the people. But I rather come vnto the maine poynt here to be noted, which is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles aſſeueration, that his bands and impriſonment turned rather to the furthering then to the hindering of the Goſpell, for contrarie to the expectation and hope of thoſe aduerſaries of the Goſpell, that caſt him into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Whence I obſerue, that the perſecutions &amp; afflictions of the Saints of Chriſt Ieſus, do rather further then hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

So that now it was like that idolatry ſhould increaſe, and that the worſhip of the true God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould decreaſe, becauſe of this cruell execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon theſe three children, for the maintenance of his holy worſhip, and refuſall to worſhip the image. But loe how the Lord turned this to the ſpreading and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of his holy worſhip, throughout all the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:599:95"/> of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> For the Lord hauing wrought a mighty deliuerance for the three children, in ſauing them from the power of the fire,<note place="margin">27.</note> ſo that neither an haire of their head was burnt, nor their cotes changed, nor any ſmell of fire was vpon them, both all the Nobles and great Princes which came to worſhip the golden image, were ſpectators of this great wonder which the true God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wrought, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himſelfe <hi>bleſſed the God of Shadrach,</hi>

And as this may be ſeene in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, ſo alſo it is clearely ouer-ruled in the new Teſtament. You know the rage of Satan, and his inſtruments againſt our bleſſed Sauiour. from his cradle to his croſſe how did they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him, and all to deſtroy &amp; to aboliſh his kingdom for euer? How was he perſecuted and forced to flie from place to place euen in his infancie? How often was he tempted by the Deuill in the wildernes? How deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully was he intreated by the high Prieſts, the Scribes, and Phariſies, and the reſt of the Iewes? How was he mocked, buffeted, ſpit vpon, crowned with a crowne of thornes, accuſed, condemned, and crucified betweene two theeues? And when they had taken him and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, then they thought they had made ſure worke for the rooting out of his name, and of his doctrine for euer. But ſo the Lord prouided, that by his croſſe his kingdome was eſtabliſhed, and by his death the life of his Church was preſerued, ſo that his ſufferings and his wrongs were turned to the beſt, and that which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed would haue hindered the Goſpell, turned to the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:599:95"/> furthering of the Goſpell. Not to trouble you with moe proofes to this purpoſe, ye know the perſecutions and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the bands and impriſonment of our Apoſtle. And when his aduerſaries had now gotten him caſt into priſon, they thought that now he ſhould be ſafe from preaching any more in Chriſt his name, that the reſt when they ſhould heare of him ſhould be daunted, and not dare to preach the Goſpell, and indeed that thus the whole courſe of the Goſpell ſhould moſt certainely be hindered. But ſuch was the Lord his prouidence, that he turned their deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into the imagination of a vaine thing, and that which they thought ſhould haue beene to the hindering, he turned rather to the furthering of the Goſpell. For, as himſelfe here witneſſeth, by occaſion of his bands, both the Goſpell was farther propagated, euen vnto the Emperors Court, into all places of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and into many other Countries, in all which places many thereby were brought vnto the obedience of the faith, and of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus; and likewiſe thereby the Goſpell tooke bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſetling, and deeper rooting in the hearts of many of the Paſtors of the Church, inſomuch that many of them were ſo farre from being danted by his bands, that thereby they were a great deale bolder then before, and durſt more frankly and freely profeſſe and preach the Goſpell then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So that whether we looke into <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, vnto Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, ſtill we ſhall finde that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is it by the meris of the Saints, by the vertue of their ſufferings, by the force of their bloud which they ſhed for the Goſpell? No,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:599:96"/> nor ſo: for all their merits are not of that worth, all their ſufferings and deaths haue not that vertue, that thereby the Goſpell ſhould be fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By the example of the Saints conſtancie in their ſufferings. 3. By the freedome of the Goſpell then when the Saints are bound for the Goſpell. For ſuch is the power of Chriſt, that howſoeuer their enemies doe band themſelues againſt his Saints, ſo to worke the ſubuerſion of the Goſpell, and of the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, yet he can at his pleaſure, and doth make their deuiſes to be of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, nor onely ſo, but turneth them to a cleane other end then they had imagined.

If we do not beare our croſſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be that is laid vpon vs, we cannot be his diſciples. And withall I adde, that howſoeuer they ſeemed to admire the word, and to kiſſe the Goſpell, yet, if when the winde bloweth, and the ſtorme ariſeth, they ſtart aſide like a broken bowe, ſurely they were neuer borne a new by the immortall ſeede of the word of God; for that endureth for euer, as true in it ſelfe, ſo grounded in him that is begotten thereby, in ſuch ſort, that it is dearer vnto him than his life. Let them then looke vnto it, that when ſtormes ariſe, fall away from the hope of their profeſſion. If they faint or ſhrinke, it is more then they ſhould doe, becauſe the Lord may turne their ſufferings to the furtherance of the Goſpell. But if they fall away, it is as if they refuſed to take vp their croſſe, and to follow Chriſt. And whereas their liues ſhould not bee deare vnto them vnto the death, for the furthering of the goſpell; their liues, and liuelyhoodes are ſo deare vnto them, that to ſaue them they hinder the goſpell. Let this be our rule, the Lord turnneth the perſecutions of his Saints to the furthering of the goſpell, therefore in perſecutions and troubles we may not faint, or ſlide backe.</p>
                  <p>Againe beloued, this may teach you not to doubt of the truth, or to diſlike of the profeſſors of the truth, becauſe they are diſgraced, perſecuted, and cruelly entreated. Yee ſhall not want enough that will inſult ouer them in their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:599:98"/> troubles, that will tell you they are odious men, and me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> vnto whom ſuch ſufferings and troubles moſt iuſtly do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, and ſo cunningly will labour to diſcredite the truth which they profeſſe. But be not deceaued; Whatſoeuer of this kinde can bee ſaid, no doubt was ſpoken vpon <hi>Paules</hi> bands and troubles, ſo to diſcredite the goſpell which hee preached. And it cannot be but that the world ſhould hate, and perſecute, and reuile the children of the light, becauſe they loue darkeneſſe better then light. But howſoeuer the world hate them, and whatſoeuer it practiſeth againſt them, the Lord ſhall turne all their ſufferings and their wrongs to the furthering of the goſpell. Let not therefore the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and troubles of Gods Saints bee any argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, but rather for the truth, and rather let them cauſe vs to like then to diſlike the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is Satans arte to turne their troubles to the ſlaunder of them, and of the truth, but the Lord turneth them to the furtherance of the goſpell, and of their reckoning in the day of Chriſt. And let this be ſpoken touching this, which is the maine poynt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be noted in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>The next thing which I note is, that the Apoſtle in his proofe that his bands were turned rather to the furthering of the goſpell, then the hindering, ſaith, that his bands in Chriſt .i. w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he ſuſtained for Chriſt his ſake were famous throughout all the iudgement Hall, and in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Whereby he meaneth, that by occaſion of his bands Chriſt and his goſpell came to be knowen, and to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, both in the Emperours Court, and in the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in many other countries. Which as it ſheweth a notable fruite and effect of the perſecution of gods Saints, namely, the propagation of the goſpell, which falleth in with the former obſeruation. So farther, hence I do obſerue the power of God, to raiſe vp a Church vnto himſelfe where he will, and by what meanes he will, in Kings courts, in great Cities &amp; Countries where the goſpell is ſcant heard of, or little regarded, there hee can, if hee will, euen by the bands of his Saints, raiſe vp a Church vnto himſelfe.

No lewdneſſe or wickedneſſe ſo grieuous and abhominable, but there it is ſo riſe that it ouerfloweth all: Yet in theſe places the Lord hath his Church, euen thoſe that know him, and belieue in his holy name. Euen in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabels</hi> Court he hath an <hi>Obadiah</hi> to hide and feede his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and in ſinnefull <hi>Sodome,</hi> hee hath a righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> whoſe ſoule is daily vexed with their vnlawfull deeds. Farre be it therefore, from vs, to condemne where the Lord hath not condemned. Who are his he onely knoweth, but that in all places he hath thoſe that are his, we are not to deſpaire, yea, euen at this day in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Court, and in ſinnefull <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which I note is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that many of the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Lord were emboldned through his bands, and durſt more franckely ſpeake the word. Whereby hee meaneth, that through his conſtancie in his bands &amp; ſufferings, many Paſtors &amp; teachers were embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to profeſſe and preach the goſpell more freely then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Whence I obſerue another notable fruite and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Gods Saints, namely, the emboldening of others to the profeſſion of the goſpell more freely. Which, as it ſerueth very notably for the proofe of the maine poynt, that the perſecution of Gods Saints rather furthereth then hindereth the goſpell, ſo may it be a ſtrong conſolation for the children of God againſt the time of perſecution. It may bee that ſome of vs in the time of the peace of the goſpell, may doubt how wee ſhall ſtand in the time of perſecution, and feare, that when the tryall ſhall come, we ſhall not quit our ſelues like men. But let vs plucke vp our hearts, and be of good comfort. When wee ſhall ſee the conſtancy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Gods Saints in their ſufferings, then ſhall we alſo be emboldened freely to profeſſe the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, the Lord ſhall turne the conſtancie of them in their ſufferings, for the hope of their profeſſion vnto our encouraging and emboldening to make a good profeſſion. Thus we finde it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:599:99"/> to be in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> of whome it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.57</note> that he had beene the Diſciple of Ieſus before his Paſſion: But he ſhewed it not till then, and then hee went euen to <hi>Pylate</hi> himſelfe, and profeſſed himſelfe his Diſciple, and begged his bodie, and entombed it. The like we finde to be in <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,</hi> of whome it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.39.</note> that till the death and paſſion of Chriſt Ieſus, he onely came vnto him by night, for feare of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> But then he profeſſed himſelfe, and ioyned with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> to burie him moſt honourably. By whoſe examples, as alſo by the example of theſe heere mentioned in our Apoſtle, yee ſee how the Lord, by the ſufferings of his Saints, giues that boldnes and courage vnto others of his children, which neither themſelues felt, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any ſaw in them before. Let vs not therfore feare how we ſhall ſtand when perſecution commeth, but let vs depend on the Lord, who alone giueth ſtrength and perſeuerance, and he will ſtrengthen vs to ſtand.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow followeth the amplification of the latter effect and fruit of the Apoſtles bands, which was the third thing noted in the former part of the Apoſtles narration, ſet downe in theſe words, <hi>Some preach Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> In which words the Apoſtle ſheweth that of thoſe brethren in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:599:100"/> Lord which through his conſtancie in his bands, were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened to preach Chriſt more frankly then before, all of them did not preach Chriſt with the ſame minde, nor vpon the ſame motiue, nor for the ſame end, but ſome with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minde, moued through enuy and ſtrife, and to the end to adde more afflictions to the Apoſtles bands; and others of a good minde, moued through loue, and to the end that with the Apoſtle they might defend the goſpell. So that here is ſet downe a diſtribution of ſuch as preached Chriſt, according to the diuerſitie of the mindes wherewith, of the motiues wherevpon, and of the ends wherefore they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt. The diſtribution is this, that ſome preached Chriſt ſincerely, and others not ſincerely, ſet downe <hi>ver.</hi> 15.

Touching their mindes, the better ſort preached Chriſt of good will, and a good minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Apoſtle, and toward the Goſpell; but the worſe ſort preached Chriſt not purely, but of a corrupt and bad minde toward the Apoſtle. Touching their motiues, the better ſort preached Chriſt euen vpon loue towards the Apoſtle, and towards the Goſpell; but the worſe ſort prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt vpon enuie toward the Apoſtle, and to ſtirre ſtrife and contention in the Church among the brethren. Touching their ends, the better ſort preached Chriſt to helpe the Apoſtle in the defence of the goſpell, knowing that he was appointed of God for the defence of the goſpel; but the worſe ſort preached Chriſt to adde more affliction to his bands, thinking by the contentions which they raiſed in the Church, both to greeue him, and to exaſperate <hi>Nero</hi> againſt him. Thus I reſolue the order and meaning of theſe words.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:599:101"/> comming to preach Chriſt is to glorifie the Lord, to beget children in the faith, to comfort the humbled and afflicted ſoule, to build vp the ruined walles of Sion, and to turne them that belong vnto the Lord vnto righteouſneſſe, that they may receiue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus. But in others it is greatly to bee feared, that the end of their comming to preach Chriſt, is to grieue the ſoule which the Lord would not haue greeued, to caſt dunge in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their brethren, to adde affliction vnto them that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready are afflicted, and vnder the name of the Church, to wound the Church euen with a deadly wound. I wiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede euen from my very heart roote, that all that preach Chriſt in our Church at this day were of the better ſort, and that our day might haue this exception from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles day. And I doe aſſure my ſelfe that there were neuer moe in our Church, then at this day there are, which preach Chriſt of a pure and good minde, vpon a ſincere and holy loue towards the Church, and towards the truth, to gaine men vnto the Church, and to ground men in the truth. Neither doe I, or dare I pronounce of any but that he ſo preacheth Chriſt. But as I ſaid, it may greatly be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that in this our day there are ſuch as doe not ſo preach Chriſt.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:599:105"/> liue by preaching the goſpell, or ſhould die by ſealing it with his bloud. Wherevpon he ſignifieth his owne indifferency to either, life, or death, and the conueniencie of his life in reſpect of them, and then he tells them how this ſhall turne to his ſaluation, in the deliuerance of his bodie out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And thus much for the opening of the meaning of theſe words in particular, which as yee ſee is ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate and obſcure. Now let vs ſee what notes we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hence for our farther vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which I note is in the maine propoſition, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, that he knoweth that this caſting of him into priſon, and this practiſing againſt him being in priſon, ſhall turne to his ſaluation, not onely of his bodie, by deliuerance out of priſon; but of his ſoule becauſe of his conſtancie in the defence of the Goſpell. Whence I obſerue, what fruit the godly may aſſure themſelues ſhall follow vpon their ſufferings and wrongs, euen their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the day of Chriſt Ieſus. For though the Apoſtle might know this ſome other way then now the godly can, euen by the reuelation of the ſpirit, as no doubt he did know of his deliuerance out of priſon, yet may the godly thus farre goe with the Apoſtle, and ſay, I know that my ſufferings and wrongs ſhall turne to my ſaluation in the day of Chriſt Ieſus. But how ſhall they know this, or aſſure themſelues of this? Euen becauſe the Holy Ghoſt hath ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</note> that <hi>all things worke together for the beſt vnto them that loue God.</hi> In which place, amongſt many other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the comfort of the godly againſt afflictions and troubles, he vſeth this drawne from the prouidence of God, who ſo wiſely ordereth and diſpoſeth all things, that eue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Be it then tribulation, perſecution, famine, nakednes, ſword, impriſonment, or what croſſe ſoeuer that doe preſſe vs, we know that all things, euen all croſſes and calamities worke together for the beſt vnto them that loue God; ſo that if we loue God, we neede not ſhrinke at all theſe, or any ſuch
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:599:105"/> like, but certainely know that they ſhall turne to our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ion. More plaine it may be to this purpoſe will be thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.12.</note> that <hi>if we ſuffer with Chriſt we ſhall alſo be glorified with Chriſt:</hi> and againe, <hi>if we ſuffer with Chriſt, we ſhall alſo reigne with Chriſt.</hi> Where it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to be noted, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>this is a ſure word, this is a true ſaying, that if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reigne with him.</hi> This then is a promiſe of the Lord vnto his children that loue him, that if they ſuffer with him for his ſake, and his Goſpels, they ſhall alſo reigne with him, and be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed with him. So that either the godly muſt doubt of the Lord his promiſes, all which are <hi>yea and amen,</hi> moſt certaine and ſure; or elſe the godly may aſſure themſelues that their ſufferings and their wrongs ſhall turne to their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the day of Chriſt Ieſus. For what better aſſurance then that which is grounded on the Lords promiſe? Or what plainer promiſes can there be, then theſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in theſe places, or rather of the Holy Ghoſt by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle? And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith in another place, that <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t is a righteous thing with God to recompenſe tribulation to them which trouble others, and to them that are troubled, reſt,</hi>

                     <hi>when the Lord Ieſus ſhall ſhew himſelfe from heauen with his mighty Angels, and ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints.</hi> It is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thing with God: righteous indeed for his iuſtice ſake, to recompenſe tribulation to them that trouble others; and righteous for his promiſe ſake, to recompenſe reſt to them that are troubled. Becauſe then God is righteous, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth promiſe for euer, therfore the godly may aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that their ſufferings and wrongs ſhall turne to their ſaluation in the day of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>Here then is a notable conſolation for all the godly in Chriſt Ieſus againſt all croſſes, perſecutions, and troubles whatſoeuer. As Chriſt was to ſuffer many things, and ſo to enter into his kingdome; ſo the godly in Chriſt Ieſus, are through many tribulations to enter into the kingdome of God. But the comfort is, that they ſhall all turne vnto their ſaluation in the day of Chriſt Ieſus, when they ſhall be <hi>for

                     </gap>hat vncomfortable doctrine of doubting of our ſaluation. For, if we may aſſure our ſelues that our ſufferings and our wrongs ſhall turne to our ſaluation, then may wee aſſure our ſelues of our ſaluation. Yea but it will be ſaid, what an argument and reaſon is this, <hi>Paul</hi> might, therefore wee may? I ſay, it is a good one, becauſe vpon the ſame ground that he might, we may. Yea, but he might know this by the reuelation of the ſpirit, which now we are not to looke for. True: but he might alſo know this out of the holy ſcripture, where the Lord hath paſſed his promiſe for this, and ſo we may: &amp; on the ſame promiſe whereon he might build his knowledge and aſſurance, on the ſame may we, and all the faithfull children of God build our knowledge and aſſurance, the promiſe being made vnto all that loue God, and are in Chriſt Ieſus. Many doubts indeed we haue, and full of diſtruſtfulneſſe we are oftentimes euen the beſt of vs: but yet yee ſee that vpon good ground of Gods promiſe, by the example of our Apoſtle, we may aſſure our ſelues of our ſaluation, if as the Apoſtle did, ſo we doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto Chriſt Ieſus, at leaſt if we ſuffer perſecution, and trouble for his ſake; for ſo farre this place will go, that if we ſuffer perſecution and trouble for Chriſt his ſake, then we may aſſure our ſelues of our ſaluation, becauſe we may aſſure our ſelues, that our ſufferings and troubles ſhall turne to our ſaluation. Suffer not your ſelues therefore, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by thoſe vncomfortable teachers of doubting, which teach that not any man, to whom it is not reuealed by the ſpirit in particular, can be ſure of his ſaluation, but onely in an vncertaine hope. As this place doth ſhew, that ſuch of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:599:107"/> the godly as ſuffer perſecution and trouble may aſſure themſelues that their troubles ſhall turne to their ſaluation, and ſo conſequently may aſſure themſelues of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo many other places doe euidently conuince, that ſo many as are in Chriſt Ieſus, may and ought to aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of their ſaluation. But I haue diuers times heretofore ſpoken of this point more at large. Let vs now therefore proceede.</p>
                  <p>If any man therefore here aske how and by what meanes it could come to paſſe, that this the Apoſtles impriſonment, and this practiſing againſt him in his impriſonment could turne to his ſaluation, himſelfe in the next words ſhewes the meanes to be, the <hi>Philippians</hi> praier, the helpe of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and his owne hearty and earneſt expectation and hope, <hi>I know &amp;c. through your praier &amp;c.</hi> Of which three, two, namely their praier, and his hearty expectation and hope were indeede meanes, but the third, namely the ſpirit of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was the author, which by and according to theſe meanes turned his ſufferings and wrongs to his ſaluation. Howbeit in a generall ſignification of meanes, we may ſay, that hee knew that by and according to theſe meanes this that he ſuffered, &amp; that they practiſed againſt him ſhould turne to his ſaluation.

Thus the Lord by his ſpirit worketh for his children through the praier of the Saints, and according to their faith and hope in him. So that thus we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue, all afflictions and troubles worke for the beſt, and turne vnto ſaluation: but vnto whom? and how? vnto ſuch as <hi>Paul,</hi> vnto the elect of God, the redeemed of Chriſt, the ſanctified by Gods ſpirit, the members of Chriſt his Church, by the helpe of the ſpirit, through the miniſtery and praiers of the Church, and according to their faith and hope in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then here can be no hope, nor ſhall be any helpe vnto ſuch as either are out of the Church, or are in the Church, but not of the Church. For albeit ſuch may haue ſufferings and wrongs, yet ſhall they not turne to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Neither can they turne vnto ſaluation, becauſe they are not for Chriſt his ſake or the Goſpels, to which kinde onely the promiſe is made. Nay vnto ſuch alients from the couenant of promiſe, their troubles in this life are but the beginnings of that fearefull iudgement which in flaming fire is reſerued for them againſt that great day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence we learne that euen vnto the godly in Chriſt Ieſus, their ſufferings and wrongs turne to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, not for any their merits, or through the vertue of their ſufferings, but through the praiers of the Saints &amp;c. If we thinke vpon merit, we may well thinke that our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle might as well haue ſtood vpon merit, as the beſt that liue could: nay in ſufferings and wrongs he was more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant then the beſt that liues is, as that place to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> ſheweth. Yet he ſtands not vpon them, but that his troubles turne to his ſaluation,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor</hi> 11.</note> he imputes it to the praier of the Church, &amp; to the help of Gods ſpirit, according to the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:599:108"/> faith and hope which God had wrought in him by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by his example teacheth vs ſo to doe. Nay, hee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſclaimeth all merit of ſaluation by affliction, and by his example teacheth vs ſo to do, where he ſaith, <hi>I count that the afflictions of this preſent time are not worthie of the glorie which ſhall bee ſhewed vnto vs.</hi>

                  <p>A good leſſon for vs, to ſtirre vs vp vnto publique and priuate prayer, both for our ſelues, and for others, ſeeing they are ſo powerfull with God, as to bring his bleſſings and graces both vpon our ſelues, and vpon others. And this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is as needfull as it is good, eſpecially in this our day, wherein there is ſuch neglect both of publique and priuate prayer vnto the Lord. Priuate praier ſo rare, that if it be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any, it is noted by many, and they ſtraight way cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, as thinking themſelues more holy then other men. And publique prayer ſo little regarded by ſome, that verie ſeldome they are preſent with the congregation in publique prayer. I cannot ſtand of it. Only, I ſay, he that neglecteth the meanes vnto grace, he ſhall neuer finde grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence I obſerue a dutie of the Church in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique prayer, which is, to pray for the afflicted members of Chriſt Ieſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: for the Apoſtle in ſaying, that he knew that this ſhould turne to his ſaluation through their praiers, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtirreth them to pray for him. And ſee the points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church is to commend them in their prayers vnto God. As firſt, that the Lord may turne their affliction and trouble to their ſaluation. Secondly, that hee will helpe them by his holy ſpirit in euerie needefull time of trouble. Thirdly, that they may ſo ſtand in the defence of the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, that in nothing they may bee aſhamed.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:599:109"/> Fourthly, that the Lord will ſtrentghen them with ſtrong faith and hope in him. Fiftly, that Chriſt may be glorified in their body, whether it bee by life, or death. Thus the Church ſhould pray, and thus the afflicted ſhould deſire the Church to pray.</p>

                  <p>Now to goe forward, what was it that the Apoſtle ſo heartily looked for and hoped?

                  <p>The firſt thing then which here I note is, the reaſon wherefore the Apoſtle was ſo indifferent either vnto life or death, which ſo euer God might be glorified by; and it was becauſe whether he liued or died, if by either death or life he might gaine glory vnto Chriſt, vnto him did accrew van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage enough. Whence I obſerue, how a Chriſtian becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth indifferent vnto either life, or death, and that is thus if Chriſt be vnto him both in life and in death aduantage, if he ſeeke no other gaine but this that Chriſt may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his body, then he is indifferent vnto whatſoeuer it is whereby Chriſt may be glorified, be it life, or death. This was it that made thoſe three children mentioned in <hi>Daniel</hi> ſo indifferent either vnto life or death. For when <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> had called them, and thundred out cruell threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt them, if they ſhould not worſhip the golden image that he had ſet vp,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16.17.18.</note> they ſaid vnto him, <hi>O Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar we are not carefull to anſwer thee in this matter. Behold our God whom we ſerue is able to deliuer vs from the hote fiery fornace, &amp;c.</hi> In which their anſwer they plainely ſhew, that it was not life or death that they ſtood vpon, but it was the glory of their God. If God ſhould deliuer them from death to his farther glory by their life, they were willing to liue; and againe, if he ſhould deliuer them vp vnto death to his further glory by their death, they were alſo willing to die. Life and death was indifferent to them by whether ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer God would be glorified in them, becauſe the glory of God was all that they ſought in life, or in death. The ſame is to be ſaid of all thoſe godly Martyrs that are dead in the Lord for the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, and for the defence of the truth of Chriſt Ieſus to the ſhedding of their
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:599:115"/> bloud. They were willing no doubt to haue liued, and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:599:117"/> end wherefore we were created and made was, as euen now we heard out of the Prophet, the glorie of God; that hee might ſhew his glory in vs, and that we againe might glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him in the land of the liuing. Secondly, wee are not our owne, but wee are bought for a price, and therefore as the Apoſtle maketh the argument,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.</note> we muſt glorifie God, euen him whoſe we are in our bodies, and in our ſpirits: hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we muſt not liue vnto our ſelues, but vnto him and his glorie, <hi>That dyed for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Gods glorie, that muſt bee the bent of our whole life, and the vantage that we muſt ſeeke while we are at home in the body.</p>
                  <p>Now, if yee aske how we are to glorifie God in our life, I anſwer, by walking faithfully in the waies of our calling, whatſoeuer our calling be, by keeping our veſſels holy vnto the Lord, and pure from all filthineſſe of corruption: by conforming our wills in all obedience vnto his will, and by liuing ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world. All which our Apoſtle comprehendeth in a conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</note> which becommeth the goſpel of Chriſt. And <hi>Peter,</hi> in an honeſt conuerſation, where he ſaith, <hi>Haue your conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honeſt among the Gentiles, that they which ſpeake euill of you, as of euill doers, may by your good works (which they ſhall ſee) glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in the day of viſitation.</hi> That God may be glorified by vs, this is a poynt which we muſt looke vnto. And how may this be? by hauing our conuerſation honeſt, that is, by ſo walking and liuing, as before was mentioned.</p>
                  <p>This then ſhould teach vs, ſo to looke vnto our wayes in our whole life, that in nothing the Lord be diſhonoured by vs. For, if the glorie of God ſhould be vnto vs the greateſt gaine of our life, while we liue herein the body, then ſhould we in all things ſeeke it, and by no meanes doe any thing which may be to the impairing of it. But, doe wee in our whole life ſeeke the glory of our God, as our greateſt gaine? Doe wee in nothing diſhonour our God throughout our whole life? If euery man ſhould but looke how faithfully he walketh in the waies of his calling, the miniſter, the Lawyer,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:599:117"/> the Phyſition, the Souldier, the Tradeſman, the Merchant, the Countrie-man, how carefull each of them in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling are, that God may be glorified by them; if euery man ſhall but looke how watchfull he is ouer his owne body, that it be not defiled with the corruptions which are in the world through luſt, what a conſcience he maketh of all his waies, that they bee framed in all obedience vnto Gods will, and how deſirous he is to leade a ſober, a righteous, and a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life in this preſent world; if, I ſay, euery man ſhall but looke into himſelfe, and ſearch, and ſee how the caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with him touching each of theſe things; each man ſhal finde in himſelfe ſo many things whereby God is diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as that I neede not to preſſe them to the ſhame of all that heare them. Beloued, the thing is too lamentable, and too true, if we will confeſſe a truth, that whom in our whole life by all meanes we ſhould glorifie, againſt him our whole life is a continuall rebellion. For what ſin is it, whereof if we dulie examine our ſelues, we may not finde our ſelues guilty? Looke vnto the firſt table. Doe wee not truſt vnto vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riches, and giue much honour to others, which is due vnto God alone, and ſo make other Gods vnto our ſelues beſides him? Doe not many in the worſhip of God vſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious rites, and will-worſhips, which God neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and ſo ſinne againſt the ſecond Commandement? Doe wee not often abuſe the name of God in periuries, in blaſphemous oaths, in ſpeaking of him lightly and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently, and ſo take his name in vaine? Doe wee not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the holy Sabbath many of vs with bodily labour on that day, many with riotous banquetting on that day: many with vnlawfull gaming on that day, and moſt of vs with neglect of ſuch holy duties as on that day were to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Looke alſo vnto the ſecond Table. Doe we not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, nay, contemne our Superiours, and ſometimes euen make rebellion againſt them? Doe wee not often murther the innocent without a cauſe, if not in his life, yet in his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and name, and in a cruell ſpight againſt him? Doe we not often ſteale from our brethen, by falſe weights and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:599:118"/> by ſelling naughty wares, by bribes and extortion, by ſymonie and vſurie, by deceitfull and wrongfull dealing? Doe we not often lye one vnto another, and ſo ſmother the truth that it can neuer come to light? Doe wee not abound with ſinnefull luſts, inordinate affections, vngodly deſires, and vnruly motions? True it is which the Prophet ſaith, that <hi>by lying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

His glorie we count not our glorie, but rather we count all the time loſt that is not ſpent in the things which tend nothing to his glorie. I wiſh my words might iuſtly be reproued. Beloued, it is enough that we haue ſpent the time paſt of our life in vngodlines &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes: it is enough that hitherto we haue not glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God in our mortall bodies, as we ought. Let vs hereafter make ſtreight ſteps vnto the Lord, and let vs liue vnto his glorie, in whoſe glorie is our life. Let vs ſo make account that wee liue, if wee liue to his glorie; and whatſoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers count their gaine, let vs count his glorie our greateſt gaine.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that Chriſt is vnto him in death aduantage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he meaneth, that if he dye, and by his conſtancie in his death bring glorie vnto Chriſt, this glorifying of Chriſt by his death, is vnto him in his death an aduantage. Whence I obſerue, what vnto a Chriſtian ſhould be the thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſhould make reckoning in his death, and that is, that God be glorified by his death; and then if he dye (ſo that in his death God haue his glorie) welcome death whenſoeuer, and whatſoeuer, violent, or naturall. What ſaith our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.50.</note> 
                     <hi>I muſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be baptized with a baptiſme, and how am I grieued till it be ended?</hi> In which words hee ſhewed his great and earneſt deſire to die for vs, that the Goſpell might the ſooner be preached throughout the world. For, hauing before ſignified that his comming was to preach the goſpell, which ſhould kindle a fire throughout the world,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:599:118"/> and this fire was alreadie kindled by the preaching of the goſpell, he ſignified likewiſe that before his paſſion the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell ſhould not be publiſhed throughout the world. And therefore, that he deſired to die was, that the Goſpell might the ſooner bee preached throughout the world. Heere then, ye ſee, what it was that the ſonne of God reckoned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death, namely, the glorie of God by the publiſhing of the goſpell throughout the world.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.17.</note> And becauſe he lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged after this, hee longed after death. What alſo ſaith our holy Apoſtle, <hi>Though,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I be offered vp vpon the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and ſeruice of your faith, I am glad, and reioyce with you all.</hi> Where yee ſee the Apoſtle ſaith, that hee would reioyce in death as a vantage vnto him, if by his death God might haue this glorie, that their faith thereby might bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The thing then that hee made reckoning of in his death was, that God might be glorified thereby, and ſo hee would reioyce in death. Semblably, wee in death ſhould principally looke at this, that our death be to the glorie of the Lord, that our death bee as the death of his Saints,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116.13.</note> that our death be in the Lord, and then we may reioyce and bee glad in it. For as the Prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.13</note> 
                     <hi>Right deare and precious in the ſight of the Lord, is the death of the Saints.</hi> And as our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence then we may learne, why it is that we are many of vs ſo vnwilling to dye. If perſecution ariſe becauſe of the word, and fire and faggot be the portion for vs to drinke, it is no need to bid vs to flie but we runne, and we turne, and turne, and turne againe, rather then wee will burne. If any ſicknes ſeaze vpon vs, by and by we ſo ſhrinke, and are ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of death, that whatſoeuer phyſicke by the Phyſition, whatſoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort by the Miniſter be miniſtred vnto vs, yet ſtil nothing but death death with vs. Euery ſummo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of death is ſo fearefull vnto vs, that if any way wee could wee would ſhift it off. And why is all this, but becauſe we count of no vantage in death, becauſe Chriſt is not vnto vs aduantage in death? we neuer bethinke our ſelues, ſhall God be glorified by my death? ſhall the Saints hearts be ſtrengthened by my
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:599:119"/> conſtancie, &amp; my patience in my death? ſhall the Chriſtian and quiet repoſe of my ſoule in the Lord at my death, cauſe them that behold me to glorifie the Lord? But what do we thinke and ſay, I ſhall die, I ſhall die, I ſhall go downe to the graue, and be no more ſeene; the terrors of death are vpon me, and who ſhall deliuer me? And thus death triumpheth ouer vs, whereas vpon the other cogitations, we ſhould tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer death.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.37.</note> Ye know the ſtorie of <hi>Naball,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that when his wife told him <hi>Dauids</hi> words, his heart died within him, and he was like a ſtone. So is it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs, when any ſummons of death come forth for vs, our hearts faile, and die within vs, and we are euen as ſtones. And no meruaile that feare of death ſhould ſo worke vpon vs, when in our death there is nothing to comfort vs. If our hearts were ſo ſet on the glorie of the Lord, that wee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that gaine enough vnto vs: if any way wee might gaine glory vnto the Lord by life, or by death, then would wee willingly die, whenſoeuer our death might be to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But, ſetting apart all care of Gods glorie by life, or by death, we mind onely the pleaſures and profites of this life; which haue an end in death, and therefore are vnwilling to die. In the terrors of death, then will we not feare death? Let mee die the death of the righteous, and I will not feare what death can doe vnto me. Let Chriſt Ieſus bee glorified by my death, and then let death come in fire, in ſword, in famine, in peſtilence, in what terrible ſort it can come, and I will triumph ouer death. Let this mind be in euerie one of vs, and ſo, that by our death God bee glorified in vs at what time ſo euer, and in what ſort ſo euer it come, let it bee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to vs. And let this ſuffice to bee obſerued from theſe words; whence ye ſee, firſt, how we become indifferent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to either death, or life, namely, if Chriſt be vnto vs both in life, and in death aduantage. Secondly, that the vantage whereof we are to make reckoning in our life is, that Chriſt Ieſus may bee glorified by our life. And thirdly, that the vantage whereof we are to make reckoning in our death is, that Chriſt Ieſus may be glorified by our death.</p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:599:119"/>
                  <p>Now, vpon this occaſion that hee had ſaid, that hee was very indifferent vnto either life or death, becauſe Chriſt was vnto him both in life and in death aduantage: the Apoſtle maketh a little digreſſion, and diſputeth the poynt whether were better for him to chooſe, life, or death. And firſt, in this verſe hee mooueth the doubt, and anſwereth it in theſe words, <hi>And whether, &amp;c.</hi> Which words, I know, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly read, but the words bearing well this reading, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, as both beſt opening the Apoſtles meaning, and beſt ſorting with that which followeth. Now, when hee ſaith, <hi>Whether to liue in the fleſh,</hi> ye muſt vnderſtand that to liue in the fleſh, and to liue after the fleſh are much different. For to liue after the fleſh, is to follow the filthie luſts of the fleſh and to liue in the fleſh, is onely to liue in this fraile bodie The doubt then is, whether to liue in the bodie were profi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table for him, and what to chooſe, life, or death, were beſt for him? And the anſwere is, that he knoweth not what to chooſe, life, or death. Being in his caſe, in priſon, a man would haue thought this choiſe would not haue been hard Yet, he being in priſon, ſaw ſuch comfort in death, and ſuch ioy in life, that hee knew not which rather to chooſe. And ſuch loue did hee beare towards the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great comfort which hee ſhould haue by his death, with the great profite which they ſhould haue by his life, he knew not what to chooſe.</p>
                  <p>Whence I obſerue, firſt, the great loue which ought to bee in the Paſtor towards his people, and the great deſire which he ought to haue of their profite and comfort. Euen in caſe of his greateſt comfort, ioyned with their loſſe and heauines, it ſhould much perplexe him what to chooſe; his, or their preſent comfort. Yee know that of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exo.</hi> 32.32.</note> where he prayed the Lord either to pardon his people their ſinne, or to raze him out of the booke of life. And that of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3.</note> where hee wiſhed himſelfe to bee ſeparated from Chriſt for his brethren, which were his kinſmen according to the fleſh. They both knew, the one, that hee could not be razed out of the Booke of life; and the other, that hee could not bee
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:599:120"/> ſeperated from Chriſt, onely therein they ſhewed how greatly Gods glorie in the peoples good. And true is that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note> that <hi>Loue ſeekes not her owne things, but the things of others.</hi> Whence yet I doe not inferre, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor for loue of his people, ſhould in caſe of his ſaluation wiſh his own vtter rection, rather then that his people ſhould not be gained vnto Chriſt. But this, I ſay, that euen in caſe of his and their ſaluation for the loue of his people, hee is to be perplexed how ſoone to wiſh his ſaluation by his diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe howſoeuer his preſent comfort ſhould bee gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his preſent diſſolution, yet their ſaluation ſhould be furthered by his longer continuance in the bodie.</p>
                  <p>A poynt which doth not much perplexe many Paſtors. For too many ſuch there are, as neither caring for their own ſaluation, nor their peoples, looke onely to fleece them, but neuer care what become of them. A point which might be much enlarged, but not ſo fitly in this place. If the vrging of it might concerne any here, I beſeech them in the feare of God to thinke further of it with themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I obſerue is this, that if we bee at peace with God, and keepe faith, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whatſoeuer our outward ſtate be, we haue ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ioy on euery hand, that neither we deſire to die in reſpect of the griefes of this life, nor to liue in reſpect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feare of death. The example of our Apoſtle is proofe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to this purpoſe. He lay in priſon, and of the brethren none aſſiſted him, but all forſooke him; and many practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much againſt his conſtancie, and againſt his life; ſo that his outward ſtate was very hard, and ſuch, that in reſpect of the griefes of his life, he might haue deſired death; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in reſpect of the feare of death, hee might haue deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life. Yet, euen then ſuch ioy and comfort he found on euery ſide, which way ſo euer hee lookt, to life, or death, that hee knew not whether of them to chooſe. And where was the reaſon? Though his caſe were hard, yet hee was at peace with God, and had faith, and a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Farre otherwiſe it is with many in our daie, who ſee
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:599:120"/> nothing but matter of diſcontentment and diſcomfort, both in life, and in death. If either promotion fall not vpon them according to their deſire, or if croſſes fall vpon them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then they deſire, then they grow male-contented, they care not to liue, and yet they ioy not in death. Such are they that minde earthly things, but minde not the things of God.</p>
                  <p>Let vs ſeeke to be at peace with God, let vs truſt perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Ieſus, let vs keepe a good conſcience in all things, and this ſhall make both life and death comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto vs.</p>

                  <p>A point which doth not ouermuch perplexe many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in our day: for too many ſuch there are as neither ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for their owne ſaluation, nor for their peoples, looke onely to fleece them, but neuer care elſe what become of them. Which point might be much enlarged, if the place were conuenient. If the preſſing of it might concerne any here, I beſeech them in the feare of the Lord to thinke far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it with themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which hence I obſerue is this, that if we be at peace with God, and keepe faith and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whatſoeuer our outward ſtate be, we haue ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ioy on euery ſide, that neither we deſire to die in reſpect of the griefes of this life, nor yet to liue in reſpect of any feare of death. The example of our Apoſtle is proofe enough to this purpoſe: He lay in priſon for the defence of the goſpell, wherein none of the brethren aſſiſted him, but all forſooke him, and many practiſed much againſt his conſtancie, and againſt his life; ſo that his outward ſtate was very hard, and ſuch that in reſpect of the griefes of his life hee might haue deſired death; and againe in reſpect of the feare of death, hee might haue deſired life. Yet euen then which way ſo euer he lookt, to life or death, ſuch ioy and comfort hee ſaw in both, as that neither the griefes of life made him to wiſh death, nor the feare of death made him to wiſh life. And where was the reaſon? Though his caſe many waies were hard, yet was hee at peace with God through Ieſus Chriſt his Lord; he was ſtrong in the faith of Chriſt Ieſus, whom God ſet forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloud, and he had the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, that in all ſimplicitie and godly pureneſſe he had his conuerſation in the world. And therefore ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Farre otherwiſe it is with many in our day, who ſee no thing but matter of diſcontentment and diſcomfort both in life and in death: for ſo it is with many of vs, that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And againe, many of vs if any way we be ſummoned vnto death, by ſicknes, by the ſword, by the peſtilence, or any other way, we ſo ſhrugg and ſhrinke for feare of death, that like vnto <hi>Nabal,</hi> if we ſurmiſe any danger of death by and by our <hi>hearts</hi> faint and <hi>die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs,</hi>

                     <hi>and we become like ſtones.</hi> No comfort or contentment a great many of vs finde either in death, or in life, but what through griefe of the one, and feare of the other, wee are often out of loue with the one, and with the other. And the reaſon is plaine: for it is becauſe we are not at peace with God, nor haue the myſterie of faith in a good conſcience. We feele no comfort in our God through our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Ieſus Chriſt; wee want a ſound and a liuely faith, whereby we ſhould take hold of the promiſes of God made in Chriſt Ieſus, and a bad conſcience ſo troubles vs, that all is diſquieted within vs. And therefore we finde no comfort or contentment in life, or in death, but diſcomfort and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment in both.</p>
                  <p>Will we then finde comfort and contentment in both, whatſoeuer our ſtate outwardly be? Let vs labour to be at peace with God let vs truſt perfectly in Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; let vs keep a good conſcience in all things, and this ſhall make both life and death comfortable vnto vs; whatſoeuer our outward eſtate be, both life and death ſhall be comfortable vnto vs, if we haue peace with God, and faith, and a good conſcience. And let this ſuffice to be obſerued from the doubt which the Apoſtle moueth, where he profeſſeth that he knowes not what to chuſe, life or death.</p>
                  <p>And why knew he not what to chuſe, life or death? The reaſon hereof in the words following is ſaid to be; becauſe on both ſides there were ſuch reaſons, on the one ſide to chuſe life, and on the other ſide to chuſe death, that he was in a wonderfull ſtrait on both ſides. For, ſaith hee, I am greatly in doubt, or I am in a wonderfull ſtrait on both
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:599:122"/> ſides: on the one ſide deſiring to be looſed from the priſon of this bodie, or to depart out of the earthly houſe of this tabernacle, for ſo the word may be taken actiuely,<note place="margin">

The former reaſon concerneth himſelfe, and his owne good: the latter concerneth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and their good: in the former is ſignified his great deſire to remoue out of the bodie, and to dwell with the Lord; in the latter is ſignified his great deſire to abide in the bodie for their furtherance, and ioy of their faith: vnto the former his loue toward Chriſt conſtrained him, vnto the latter his loue toward them conſtrained him: for the former it was beſt for him, for the latter it was moſt needfull for them: and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the former and the latter he was ſo perplexed, that he knew not what to chuſe, life or death; death for his owne preſent good, or life for their further good.</p>
                  <p>Now the thing which in the former reaſon I note is, that the Apoſtle deſired euen with a great deſire to be looſed from the priſon of his bodie, or to depart out of the bodie, and to be with Chriſt where he ſitteth at the right hand of the throne of God; and that he counted this better for him in reſpect of himſelfe, then to liue in the bodie. Whence I obſerue that a Chriſtian in reſpect of himſelfe is rather to deſire to die then to liue, to depart out of the bodie, then to abide in the bodie. Vnto the proofe of this point out of this place, adde alſo that other of our Apoſtle, where to the ſame purpoſe, and in the ſame words almoſt he ſaith thus, <hi>We loue rather to remoue out of the bodie,</hi>

                     <hi>or why died I not when I came out of the wombe? O that God would deſtroy me, that he would let his hand goe, and cut me off: my ſoule chuſeth rather to be ſtrangled and to die then to be in my bones.</hi> Yes indeede this was a great fault in <hi>Iob</hi> thus in impatiency to breake out, and to ſearch for death more then for treaſures. Neither is any man, be his croſſes or troubles neuer ſo great, neuer ſo many, through impatiencie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is weary of his life, to wiſh rather to die then to liue; much leſſe is he with curſed <hi>Achitophel,</hi> or traiterous <hi>Iudas</hi> to become his owne butcher, and to cut off his owne daies: for this were to repine againſt the higheſt, and to take our owne matters out of Gods into our owne hands. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian therefore in reſpect of himſelfe is to deſire rather to die then to liue, but in no ſort through impatiencie, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is weary of his life. Yea but is not death terrible euen vnto the godly, and doe they not oftentimes ſo ſhrinke thereat that they are afraid of it? Yes ſurely, death in it ſelfe, and in it owne nature is ſo terrible, that <hi>Dauid</hi> being in great heauineſſe and diſtreſſe by reaſon of <hi>Sauls</hi> cruelty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it thus ſaying,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The terrors of death are fallen vpon me.</hi> Whereby he meaneth that he was ſo afraid of his enemies, as if death had beene ready to ſeaze vpon him. And ſurely but for Chriſt Ieſus, that hee hath ſeaſoned it, and that through him it is but a paſſage vnto a better life, wee might all of vs, euen the beſt of vs well feare death, as the fruit of ſinne, and as the reward or wages of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>How then doe we ſay, that a Chriſtian in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is to deſire rather to die then to liue? We muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that a Chriſtian is to deſire rather to die then to liue: but how? not ſimply rather to die then to liue, but ſo as <hi>Paul</hi> did, rather to die, and to be with Chriſt then to liue. He doth not ſay to die, and to be ridd out of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this life: for ſo many deſire, whoſe deſire is not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:599:123"/> good, and for whom it were better rather to liue in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die then to die; but he ſaith, <hi>to die, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Are we not then while we liue here in the bodie with Chriſt, and Chriſt with vs? If wee will ſpeake as the ſcripture vſually doth we are not. While we liue here in the bodie we are in Chriſt by his ſpirit, and Chriſt in vs by faith, as appeareth by many places of holy ſcripture; but in the vſuall phraſe of the ſcripture then principally wee are faid to bee with Chriſt, when after the ſeparation of the ſoule from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die we doe in ſoule enioy the continuall preſence of Chriſt in heauen, where he ſitteth at the right hand of the throne of God: euen as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, where hee ſaith, <hi>Whiles we are at home in the bodie, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.</note> not from being in the Lord, but from dwelling with the Lord in the heauenly places. So that firſt our earthly houſe of this tabernacle muſt be deſtroyed before we can be with Chriſt where he is as he is man. When then we ſay that a Chriſtian in reſpect of himſelfe is to deſire rather to die then to liue, the meaning is, that he is rather to deſire the ſeparation of his ſoule from his bodie, and in ſoule to bee with Chriſt, where he is as man, till he may both in ſoule and bodie bee there with him for euer, then to liue in the bodie.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſons are plaine and cleare: as firſt becauſe Chriſt is the husband, and we the ſpouſe if we belong vnto Chriſt. As then it is better for the ſpouſe to liue with her husband then to liue apart from her husband,<note place="margin">

As then it is better to know, to loue, to liue, to ioy, &amp;c. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, than only but in part, ſo is it better to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt, where all theſe ſhall be perfected, than to liue in the body, where they are neuer but in part.

                  <p>Let this ſerue for a iuſt reproofe of them that are vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die. For come now, and let vs reaſon the caſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: What man is there among you, that if hee were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed only with ragged, and torne, and patched, and worne, and bad cloathes, would not be willing to be vncloathed of them, and to be cloathed with better? And what elſe is this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:599:124"/> mortall and corruptible body, but as ragged and rotten cloathes wherewith wee are cloathed? Why ſhould wee not then be willing to be ſhifted of thoſe cloathes, of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and corruptible body, and to bee cloathed with our houſe which is from heauen, euen with incorruption and immortalitie? Againe, what man is there among you, that if hee were in priſon, would not be willing to be ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? or being in a place where he is but a ſtranger, would not be willing to be at home? And what elſe is this ſinfull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but as a priſon of the ſoule, wherein it is ſo ſhut, that it hath no libertie till it returne vnto him that gaue it? Or what elſe is this world, but as a place wherein wee wander as pilgrims, and haue no abiding Citie? Why ſhould wee not then be willing to remoue out of this priſon of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and to bee receiued into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God? or to looſe anchor from this land, wherein wee are but ſtrangers, and by death to ſaile towards heauen, where is our home, and our abiding Citie? Where ſhould the members ioy to be, but with their head? Where ſhould the ſpouſe deſire to bee, but with her husband? Where ſhould man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, delight to bee, but with him that is his life, to ſee him as hee is, and to liue in his continuall preſence? Surely whoſoeuer thou art that art vnwilling to die, thou doeſt not yet conceiue nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the bleſſed eſtate of them that die in the Lord; thou haſt not yet throughly learned this leſſon, that Chriſt is the husband of the Church, that Chriſt is the life of his body, that in the preſence of Chriſt there is fulneſſe of ioy, and life for euermore: for then wouldeſt thou willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire with the Apoſtle to bee looſed, and to bee with Chriſt, which is farre the beſt. If the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beaſts, were euen as one condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto them, ſo that in their death there were indeed no difference, or if after death there remained nothing but a fearefull expectation of iudgement, then indeed thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſome reaſon to be vnwilling to die. But now that Chriſt by death hath triumphed ouer death, and made death vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:599:125"/> thee (if thou belong vnto him) a paſſage vnto life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out death, vnto ioy without ſorrow, vnto all bleſſedneſſe without any miſerie, why ſhouldeſt thou bee vnwilling to die? Nay now a chip for death, nay now moſt welcome death. And ſo beloued let it be to euery one of vs. If wee belong vnto Chriſt, there is no cauſe why wee ſhould feare death, and great cauſe there is why wee ſhould embrace death. Let vs therefore neuer feare death, nor be vnwilling to die, but whenſoeuer the Lord his will is, let vs be willing to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow to proceed: Againſt this which hath beene ſaid, it may be obiected, that as no man is to put aſunder the things which God hath coupled together, as the ſoule and the body; ſo no man is to deſire that the things which God hath coupled bee ſundred, and therefore no Chriſtian is to deſire to die. Whereunto I anſwer, that it is true, that no Chriſtian is to deſire ſimply to die, nor to die to this end only, that he may be rid of the miſeries of this life, nor to die otherwiſe than when the Lord his will is: but yet he may deſire to die, and to be with Chriſt, to die to this end that hee may bee with Chriſt, to die when the Lord his will is, and when his death may be for his glory.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.4</note> So it is to be vnderſtood of <hi>Elias,</hi> that he deſired to die, when he praied and ſaid, <hi>It is enough, O Lord, take my ſoule, for I am no better than my fathers.</hi> And
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:599:125"/> ſo wee ſay, that a Chriſtian may deſire to die when the Lord his will is, not for that death in it ſelfe is to be deſired, but becauſe he deſireth to be with Chriſt. So that the thing which a Chriſtian deſireth ſimply and in it ſelfe, is to bee with Chriſt; neither doth he otherwiſe deſire to be looſed, but that he may be with Chriſt: and ſo wee ſay he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be looſed when the Lord his will is. And thus much for this, which is the chiefe point in theſe words: whence ye ſee, that a Chriſtian in reſpect of himſelfe may deſire rather to die than to liue.</p>
                  <p>Other things there are which may not vnfruitfully bee noted in theſe words, which I will only briefly touch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are things not principally intended. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle deſireth to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt: to bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, why? that he might be with Chriſt.

                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:599:126"/> whoſe deaths, vnto the one was the departure of his ſoule out of his body into heauen, but vnto the other the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his ſoule out of his body into hell. Or if the perſons of theſe proue not ſtrongly enough, take for example the death of the two theeues which were hanged with our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour on the Croſſe, vnto the one of which Ieſus ſaid, that that day hee ſhould be with him in Paradiſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43.</note> but vnto the other that railed on him, his death doubtleſſe was a downfall into hell.</p>
                  <p>Is then the diſſolution of Gods Saints a paſſage of the ſoule out of the body vnto heauen, there to be with Chriſt? Farre be it then from vs, to thinke that the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beaſts, is euen as one condition vnto them; that when man dieth, hee returneth wholly vnto the duſt, and hath no more fruit of all the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels that hee hath taken vnder the Sunne. Thus indeede ſenſuall man following onely the iudgement of his weake ſenſe, and of his owne blinde reaſon, thinketh, and ſaith, As the one dieth, ſo dieth the other; man and beaſt haue all one breath, and in death there is no excellencie of man aboue the beaſt: all goe to one place, all to the earth, as all came from the earth. But the ſpirit of God hath otherwiſe taught vs in his holy word: for doth not the Lord ſay, that he is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.32.</note> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Iacob?</hi> And doth he not ſay, that he is not the God of the dead, but of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing? <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> then are not dead, but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Liuing? How? In their ſoules with God. Dead they are in reſpect of the ſeparation of their ſoules from their bodies. But foraſmuch as the earthly houſe of their Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle being deſtroyed, they haue a building giuen of God, that is, an houſe not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.</note> as the Apoſtle witneſſeth euen of all the Saints of God, therefore they are ſtill liuing in their ſoules with God in the heauenly habitations. Howſoeuer then the bodies of men be mortall, and in death goe downe vnto the duſt, whence firſt they came; yet their ſoules are immortall, and in death returne vnto the Father of ſpirits, whence they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:599:126"/> came. But what needs more to this purpoſe then that which here our Apoſtle ſaith? In death the ſonnes of men are looſed, that is, their ſoules are ſeparated from their bodies. Now if the ſoule were mortall as the body, what needed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny looſing of the one from the other? Surely both ſhould fall together, and not the one bee looſed from the other if the condition of both were one. Euen this then, that the ſoules in death are looſed from the bodies of men ſheweth that the ſoules are immortall. Againe, in death the Saints of God are looſed that they may be with Chriſt: After death then they are with Chriſt, not in body, for that deſcendeth vnto the graue there to reſt vntill the reſurrection. In ſoule then. In death then the ſoules of Gods Saints paſſe out of the body vnto heauen there to be with Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore farre be it from vs to thinke that in death as of beaſt, ſo of man there is vtterly an end, and an entire returne vnto the duſt.</p>
                  <p>And yet ſo we liue, a great many of vs, as if we made no other reckning, for do we not a great many of vs, paſſe our dwelling here without feare in chambering and wantonnes in gluttony and drunkeneſſe, in ſtriefe and enuying? Doe we not euen glut ourſelues with ſporting and pleaſure, and ſundry delights of the fleſh, and ſay let vs be merry, and take our fils of pleaſure while we are here? for when we are gone then all the world is gone with vs. Surely, if a man may coniecture by our diſſoluteneſſe of life, a great many of vs either thinke that in death there is vtterly an end of vs, or too little thinke what remaineth after death. Beloued, wee are bought with a price, let vs therefore glorifie God both in our bodies, and in our ſpirits. We may not liue vnto our ſelues, nor giue our members weapons of vnrighteouſnes vnto ſinne, but we muſt liue vnto him that died for vs, and roſe againe; and giue our members ſeruants vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in holineſſe. Let vs ſo liue that in our liues wee thinke of death, and let vs know that if we die the death of the Saints, we ſhall die to liue for euer with Chriſt; but if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; our part ſhall be in that lake that euer burneth.</p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:599:127"/>
                  <p>Againe, this may ſerue for the confutation of that fooliſh dreame of purgatorie. The ſoules of Gods Saints they are looſed in death from the body, and being looſed are with Chriſt: The ſoules of the wicked they likewiſe in death are looſed from the body, and being looſed do, as it is ſaid of <hi>Iudas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 5.25.</note> go to their owne place, euen the place of the damned Where then is Purgatorie? They that trouble the Church with this fancie, tell vs that of them that die, ſome are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and iuſt men, and they go ſtreight vnto heauen, others are deſperately wicked, and they goe ſtreight downe into hell; and others are neither perfitly good, nor thoroughly badde, and for theſe are Purgatorie. But I demaund them touching this third ſort of men, haue they faith, or no? They grant they haue, but a weake faith not a perfit faith. If they haue faith, if it be a true and liuely faith though it bee but a weake faith, by it they are ſaued, and in death receiued vnto glory.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>He that belieueth</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) <hi>hath eternall life.</hi> He that belieueth: what? hee that hath ſuch a meaſure of faith, he that hath ſuch a degree of perfection of faith? No, but he that belieueth truely though weakly, and imperfectly, he hath eternall life, euen liuing in the body, he hath eternall life in hope, and when he remoueth out of the body ſhall haue it in poſſeſſion; hath it now in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and then ſhall haue it in a greater fruition. Againe, I demand touching this third ſort of men, where doth the Apoſtle euer exempt himſelfe from the number of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit men?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12.</note> where doth he euer count himſelfe perfit? Nay in this Epiſtle he plainely denieth it, and both there, and often elſewhere ſignifieth his endeauouring and contending after perfection. And yet being looſed he ſpeaketh not of going into Purgatorie, but of being with Chriſt. Thus then wee teach, that al that dy, die either in the faith of Chriſt, &amp; ſo be with Chriſt; or elſe die not in the faith of Chriſt, and ſo they go to their place with <hi>Iudas.</hi> As for any, third place it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed dreame, and clearely confuted by the Scriptures. The ſumme of all is, the ſoules of Gods Saints being looſed from the body are with Chriſt, therefore we are neither to thinke
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:599:127"/> that when man dieth he wholy returneth to the duſt, nor yet that he goeth vnto Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Another thing yet farther here I note, which is that the Apoſtle deſired to be with Chriſt. Where I obſerue, that till man bee looſed from the earthly houſe of this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and be in heauen, hee is not with Chriſt. To which purpoſe alſo is that of our Apoſtle, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.</note> that <hi>whiles we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord:</hi> While we liue then here in the body, we are abſent from the Lord. Firſt then we muſt remoue out of the body before wee can be with the Lord: with the Lord I ſay in corporal preſence. For otherwiſe, touching his ſpirituall preſence, wee know that he hath ſaid vnto vs, <hi>I am with you alwaies vntill the end of the word.</hi> But touching his corporall preſence he hath ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.8.</note> 
                     <hi>the poore alwaies yee haue with you, but mee yee ſhall not haue alwaies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then ſerueth for the confutation of the corporall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Lord his ſupper. A certaine truth it is, that Chriſt is truely and really preſent in the Sacrament of the Lord his ſupper, and that ſo many as come vnto that holy ſupper hauing on their wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hauing duely examined themſelues touching their faith towards God, their repentance for their ſins, and their loue of God, and of their brethren, doe there truely and really eate the body, and drinke the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus. For there ſpiritually we eate the body, and drink the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus; there ſpiritually Chriſt is giuen vnto vs, and taken of vs to be one with vs, and we with him, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually I ſay, and therefore truely and really. And therfore when we come vnto that holy Table, to be made partakers of thoſe great and high myſteries of Chriſt his bleſſed death and paſſion, we muſt know that the ground is holy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſtand, we muſt know that wee are preſent before the Lord, ſo that accordingly we muſt prepare our ſelues to the reuerend receiuing of thoſe holy myſteries, which in this place at this time I adde, becauſe it is likely that many here preſent purpoſe to morrow to communicate at that holy
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:599:128"/> table. But for Chriſt his corporall preſence in that ſupper we vtterly denie it. And for this time let this one place bee enough to proue it. For why ſhould the Apoſtle deſire to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt if before he were looſed he were with Chriſt? If he deſired to be with him by faith, and by the ſpirit, ſo hee was with him before hee was looſed It was otherwiſe then that he deſired to be with Chriſt, euen to enioy his corporall preſence. If then that he might enioy his corporall preſence, firſt he muſt be looſed, then it is cleare that while we liue here in the body Chriſt is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally preſent with vs, he is not therfore corporally preſent in the ſacrament. I haue ſtaied longer vpon theſe points then I purpoſed. Let vs now proceede vnto that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neuertheleſſe]</hi> Hetherto we haue ſpoken of the Apoſtles deſire in reſpect of himſelfe, which was to be looſed and to be with Chriſt, which was the beſt of all for him. Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth his deſire in reſpect of them, which was to abide in the body, which was more needfull for them; that by the worke of his miniſtery they might be farther builded vp in he faith and truth of Chriſt Ieſus. Neuertheleſſe ſaith hee, though it bee beſt of all for mee in reſpect of my ſelfe to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt, yet it is more needefull for you that I abide in the body, and liue longer, and therefore in reſpect of you I deſire to liue longer. And thus I am in a ſtrait on both ſides, whether to chuſe that which is beſt for me, or that which is more needfull for you, in my deſires greatly affecting both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, in that the Apoſtle deſired to liue longer in the body for their ſakes, although for himſelfe it had been farre the beſt to haue beene looſed: hence I obſerue that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are not only to looke vnto that which is beſt for our ſelues, but vnto that which is moſt for Gods glorie, and our brethrens good. Had it not beene the beſt for <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſonne ſhould haue liued,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.10</note> in whom it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed? No doubt he deſired it euen from his ſoule. But when the Lord
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:599:128"/> required him to be <hi>offered for a burnt offering, Abraham</hi> obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtretched out his hand to haue killed his ſonne. He lookt not ſo much vnto his owne deſires in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as vnto the glorie of the Lord, and therefore addreſſed himſelfe vnto his commaundement. So no doubt it was farre the beſt for <hi>Moſes</hi> to haue his name ſtill to remaine in the booke of life. Yet ſeeing the Lord his fierce wrath hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindled againſt his people, hee lookt not ſo much what was beſt for himſelfe, as what was good for his brethren the children of Iſrael;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ex.</hi> 32.32.</note> and therefore praied the Lord either to pardon the people that had ſinned, or to raze him out of the booke that he had written. So tendred hee his brethrens good and Gods glory, that he preferred that before himſelfe and his owne good. So our Apoſtle in his brethrens caſe which were his kinſmen according to the fleſh, wiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſeparated from Chriſt for their ſakes. Hee ſaw and knew what was beſt for himſelfe, euen that he ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the vine whereinto he was ingrafted. Yet as a man forgetting, or not regarding that which was beſt for himſelf, he lookt ſo much vnto the good of his brethren that hee brake out and ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3.</note> 
                     <hi>I would wiſh my ſelfe ſeparated from Chriſt for my brethren, that are my kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi> And ſo ſhould it be euen with all of vs, wee ſhould not alwaies looke what is beſt for our ſelues, but alſo what is moſt meete and needfull for Gods glory. And though, as we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it were farre better for vs to bee looſed, and to be with Chriſt in reſpect of our ſelues then liue in the body, yet are we alſo to looke what is more needfull for Gods glorie, and if to liue in the body bee more requiſite and needefull for Gods glorie then are wee to deſire to be in the body.</p>
                  <p>Good for the Church, and good for the common-wealth it would bee if men could thus frame their deſires, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to runne vpon that which is beſt for themſelues, but that which is moſt for Gods glory, and for the good of our brethren. For why is it that in Church, and in Common-weale things are ſo farre amiſſe as they are. Wee complaine much, and ô things were neuer ſo badde, neuer ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:599:129"/> in Church, or in Common-weale. And where is the cauſe? Euen within our ſelues. Few ſuch parents as was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; few ſuch magiſtrates as was <hi>Moſes;</hi> few ſuch mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as was <hi>Paul</hi> that ſo bridle their deſires, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre Gods glory and the publike good before their owne good. The miniſter now can ſee and ſay, this were more needfull for the Church, but this is better for me, more eaſe for me, more commodious for me, more pleaſant vnto me, and blame me not if I moſt reſpect that which is beſt for my ſelfe; indeed the worſt for himſelfe, but the beſt in his corrupt account. The magiſtrate likewiſe now can ſay this and this indeed were beſt of all for the common good, neuertheleſſe, this is better for mee, and neere is my coate, but neerer is my ſhirt, and I count him a very foole that is not chiefely wiſe for himſelfe. Parents likewiſe now can ſay, to beſtow ſome of my goods and ſubſtance thus and thus were moſt indeed for Gods glory, and for the good of many of Gods children: neuertheleſſe is more needfull for my children, and no man may blame mee if they be the deareſt vnto mee, if what I haue I keepe for them. And thus our deſires are carried cleane otherwiſe then were our Apoſtles. He much deſired his owne priuate good, but more the glorie of God, and the good of others. We much deſire the glory of God, and the good of others, ſhall I ſay ſo? I wiſh it might be truely ſaid of many mo that it is: but be it ſo, we much deſire the glorie of God, and the good of others, but more our owne priuate good, more that which we count beſt for vs. If then we will haue ſuch things as are amiſſe in Church and Common-weale amended, Miniſter, and Magiſtrate, and all of vs muſt reforme our deſires. Howſoeuer this or that were beſt for the Miniſter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelfe, yet muſt hee looke vnto that which is more needful for Gods glorie and the good of his Church, and ſet his deſires vpon that. Howſoeuer this or that were beſt for the Magiſtrate in reſpect of himſelfe, yet muſt hee looke vnto that which is more needfull for Gods glorie, and the good of the Common-weale, and ſet his deſires vpon
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:599:129"/> that. Howſoeuer this or that might be beſt of all for vs in reſpect of our ſelues; yet, if another thing be more neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Gods glorie, and the good of others, we muſt looke vnto that, and ſet our deſires on that.<note place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nother thing yet there is which here is to be noted, and that is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that it is more needefull for the <hi>Philippians</hi> that he liue longer, then that hee bee looſed. Whence I obſerue, that the long life of the faith full Paſtor is very needefull for the Church, and the bleſſing of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. A plaine proofe whereof, we haue in the example of <hi>Iehoida,</hi> touching whom it is ſaid,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 24.2.17.</note> 
                     <hi>That Ioaſh did vprightly in the fight of the Lord, all the dayes of Iehoiada the Prieſt. But after the death of Iehoiada came the Princes of Iudah, and did
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:599:130"/> reuerence to the King, and the King hearkened vnto them, and they left the houſe of the God of their Fathers, and ſerued groues and idols.</hi> What a bleſſing of the Lord was here vpon <hi>Ioaſh</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and vpon all <hi>Iudah</hi> by the life of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the Prieſt? So long as hee liued, <hi>Ioaſh</hi> did that which was good in the ſight of the Lord, and <hi>Iudah</hi> walked in the waies of the Lord; but when hee was dead, then <hi>Ioaſh</hi> the King, and <hi>Iudah</hi> with him, reuolted from the true ſeruice of the Lord, and fell vnto idolatry. And therefore the Lord pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to viſite the iniquities of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſay</hi> 3 2.</note> and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them threateneth to take away from them the Iudge, and the Prophet, that is, the Magiſtrate and the Miniſter, as if he ſhould haue ſaid, that he would roote out all ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and all eccleſiaſticall diſcipline from amongſt them, and bring an vtter confuſion and deſolation vpon them. Is it then a plague of GOD vpon a land, to take away their Prophets, and their Teachers? And is it a viſitation of the peoples ſinnes vpon them? By this then ye ſee, that the continuance of the Paſtors life among the people, is the bleſſing of the Lord vpon the people; I meane the continuance of the good and faithfull Paſtors life. For otherwiſe, if the Paſtor be an idle ſheepe-heard, one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth his flocke, one that cannot, or will not feed the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Lambes of Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; leade them forth vnto greene paſtures, and vnto the ſoft running waters: then ſurely it is a great bleſſing of the Lord to deliuer the ſheepe from ſuch a ſheep-heard, &amp; to cut him off from feeding his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And therfore the Lord promiſing in mercie to viſite his diſperſed flocke, ſpeaketh thus vnto them by his Prophet, <hi>Behold,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezec.</hi> 34.10</note> 
                     <hi>I come againſt the ſheepeheards, and will require my ſheepe at their hands, and cauſe them to ceaſe from feeding the ſheepe, neither ſhall the ſheepeheards feede themſelues any more: for I will deliuer my ſheepe from their mouths, and they ſhall no more deuoure them.</hi> As then this is a great mercie of the Lord vnto the flocke of his paſture, when the Paſtor is an ill one to deliuer them from him, and to cauſe him to ceaſe from feeding them, whether by death, or how elſe ſo euer; ſo is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:599:130"/> it a great bleſſing of the Lord vpon them, when they haue a good and faithfull Paſtor and Teacher, to continue his life amongſt them, for their further growth and encreaſe in the faith and truth of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>This then, beloued, ſhould teach you, how when the Lord bleſſeth you with a faithfull Paſtor you ſhould bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards him, and that is thus, you ſhould euen pray vnto the Lord for him to continue his life long amongſt you, by whoſe life yee haue ſuch a bleſſing. Other duties, many towards them on your behalfe are commanded, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, where it is ſaid, <hi>Obey them that haue the ouerſight of you, and ſubmit your ſelues, and loue:</hi> As where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, make him that hath taught him pertaker of all his goods.</hi> Whereunto ye are alſo to adde this dutie towards them, euen to pray for the continuance of their life long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you. And ſurely, if either ye conſider the bleſſing which ye haue by the enioying of them, or the loſſe which ye haue when ſuch are taken from you, yee will ſee that yee haue great cauſe to pray for their abiding in the fleſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you. For what, if after ſuch a faithfull Paſtor ſhould ſucceede an idle ſheepe heard, a greedie wolfe, an ignorant hireling, a ſlow-belly, a peruerter of the truth, a ſcandalous man for life, one whoſe God is his belly, and whoſe glorie is to his ſhame, as too too often after ſuch light followeth ſuch darkeneſſe. How great cauſe then ſhould yee haue to waile and lament, and with <hi>Ieremie,</hi> to ſay, <hi>How is the golde become ſo dimme?</hi> While then ye haue them, how ought ye to pray for them, that long ye may haue them, and enioye the benenefits of their labours.</p>
                  <p>But how farre otherwiſe doe wee a great many of vs in many places, for ſo it is with many of vs in many places, that if our Paſtor be a faithful teacher, one that labours amongſt vs in the word and doctrine, one that keepes nothing backe from vs, but faithfully deliuers vnto vs the whole counſaile
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:599:131"/> of the Lord; we are ſo farre from praying for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his life, that by all meanes we labour to make him wearie of his life. If wee haue ſuch a Paſtor as neither can, nor will teach vs in the wholeſome word of truth, one that will ſuffer vs to go on in our ſinnes, and neuer awake vs out of our dead ſleepe of ſecuritie: one that will ſowe pillowes vnder our elbowes, and crie peace, peace, when there is no peace, one that will ſort himſelfe vnto our manners, and apply himſelfe vnto our humors, he is a man fit for vs: hee is a milde, a ſoft man, and a good companion, and wee wiſh that he might liue for euer with vs. But if our Paſtor with the Prophets of the Lord, threaten the iudgements of the Lord againſt vs for our ſinnes; if with <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue vs boldly to our faces, for ſuch crying ſinnes as reigne amongſt vs; if with the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Steuen,</hi> in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his doctrine, hee ſhall come vpon vs and ſay, yee ſtiffe-necked &amp; of vncircumciſed hearts and eares, ye haue alwaies reſiſted the holy Ghoſt, as your fathers did ſo doe yee. If with the Apoſtle he ſhall rebuke vs, and ſay, <hi>O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh people, who hath bewitched you, that yee ſhould not obey the truth:</hi> if hee ſhall launce our ſores vnto the bottome, that ſo we may be throughly healed, if he ſhall wound the heary ſcalpe of him that goeth on in his wickedneſſe, and lay the axe to the roote of our ſinnes, him wee can by no meanes endure, he is a contentious man, a ſeditious man, a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall fellow, a troubler of the world; away with ſuch a man, hee is not worthy to liue vpon the earth. Thus the Paſtor, from whom it were a mercie of the Lord to deliuer vs, we loue and like: and him, in the continuance of whoſe liue were a bleſſing of the Lord vpon vs, wee cannot away with. So greatly are we in loue with our ſinnes and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſo little doe we loue knowledg, and the things that belong vnto our peace. But, beloued, I perſwade my ſelfe better things of a great many of you. As already you do, ſo continue to haue them that labour amongſt you in ſingular loue, for their workes ſake. Let the feete of them that bring you the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus bee beautifull
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:599:131"/> vnto you. Count the life of your faithfull Teachers a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Lord vpon you, and pray yee vnto the Lord when yee haue ſuch a bleſſing for the continuance thereof vnto you This bleſſing is as needfull for you as the greateſt bleſſing of this life, and therefore reioyce in it, and pray for it as the greateſt bleſſing of your life. And let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be obſerued from the reaſons which made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doubt what to chuſe, whether to liue in the bodie, or to remoue out of the bodie. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this am I ſure of &amp;c.]</hi> In the Apoſtles narration which began at the 12. verſe, firſt the Apoſtle told vs what ſucceſſe his bands had already had, and then what ſucceſſe he hoped they ſhould haue. Touching the ſucceſſe which they ſhould haue, we haue heard that the Apoſtle certainly looked for, and hoped that they ſhould turne to the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoule through his conſtancie in his bands, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were in life, or in death. But what ſhould be the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his bands touching the ſaluation and deliuerance of his bodie? The Apoſtle now tells the <hi>Philippians</hi> that, namely, he knew certainely that he ſhould liue, be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of priſon, &amp; be reſtored to them againe. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he tels them wherefore God would now deliuer him, &amp; haue him yet to liue longer, which was for theſe two ends: 1. for their furtherance &amp; ioy of their faith, .i. that by his miniſterie they might be confirmed in the faith, &amp; thereby haue their ioy increaſed: &amp; 2. that they might more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly reioyce &amp;c. .i. that they ſeeing the mighty power of Chriſt, in deliuering him from the mouth of the lion might more abundantly reioyce in Chriſt the author of his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, for deliuering him, and for bringing him againe to them. The firſt thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that he was ſure of this, that he ſhould abide in the fleſh, and continue with all the <hi>Philippians,</hi> yet for ſome time longer. Whence I obſerue, that the Apoſtle in his firſt impriſonment at <hi>Rome</hi> was deliuered, and reſtored vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churches which before he had planted; which I do the rather gather hence, for that the two words which the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:599:132"/> Apoſtle vſeth,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> ſhew that he knew ſo certainly that he ſhould be deliuered, as hee could not otherwiſe but by the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit. And in the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothie</hi> in plaine words he profeſſeth,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17.</note> that he was deliuered out of the mouth of the lyon, meaning of <hi>Nero.</hi> And the eccleſiaſticall ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries beare witneſſe, that after his firſt impriſonment, by the ſpace of ten yeares or thereabouts he preached the goſpell, and then returning to <hi>Rome</hi> againe was ſlaine by <hi>Nero,</hi> about the 14. yeare of his reigne.</p>
                  <p>Which may ſerue to encourage the faithfull thus farre in their troubles, that whatſoeuer be their troubles, if it bee for his glory, the Lord will deliuer them. As he did with <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo will he doe with vs: as our farther tryall, or pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent deliuerance ſhall be for his glory ſo will he try vs or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs. Let vs therefore in troubles be of good courage, and let vs aſſure our ſelues of deliuerance, if it be for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then vnto ſuch Chriſtians in name as liue vnto themſelues, and vnto their pleaſures? As would haue euery bodie to ſerue their turne, and care not for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? As deſire to liue rather to get goods then to do any good? For ſuch there are as ſo liue, as if they were to liue vnto themſelues, and not vnto the glory of God; as if the life of others were to be for their good, and their life not for the good of any others; as if they were to ſcrape aſmuch vnto themſelues as they could, &amp; not to do any good vnto any other. Nay I adde further, that ſuch there are as ſo liue, as if in their life they were to ſerue ſinne in the luſts thereof,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:599:133"/> as if they were to liue by the ſpoile, and hurt, and loſſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſurely ſuch are here iuſtly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as men neuer remembring that the continuance of their life ſhould be for Gods glory; or rather as men oppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing themſelues vnto euery thing that may make for Gods glory. What ſhall we ſay likewiſe vnto ſuch in the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as feede themſelues but not the flocke; as ſeeke their owne and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts; as do more harme by their bad example of life, then they doe good by their paines in teaching, as either for idleneſſe, or daintineſſe, or other like reaſon, will not put their hand vnto the Lord his worke to helpe forward the building of his houſe, nay as deſtroy the faith of ſome which were to bee builded vp in Chriſt Ieſus? Is this the end wherefore they liue in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, wherefore their life is prolonged among their people? Nay ſurely this alſo ſerueth for their iuſt reproofe, as men abuſing that vſe which God giueth them of life.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, it ſerueth for the great comfort of all them be they Chriſtians in generall, or Miniſters in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whoſe life ſerues for the good of the Church. For what greater comfort, if wee be Miniſters, can we haue of our life, then that by our life the Saints hearts be ſtabliſhed in the faith, the ioy of the faithfull be fulfilled, the Church of Chriſt Ieſus be builded, the truth of Chriſt Ieſus be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the mouth of all gaine ſayers be ſtopped, and our people kept a chaſte ſpouſe vnto the Lord? Or what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comfort can we haue of our life whatſoeuer we be, then that by our life the Lord be glorified, the good of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren procured, and the common-wealth bettered?

                  <p>Now for the further and more particular opening of the meaning of theſe words, this that the Apoſtle in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:599:135"/> of his exhortation ſaith, <hi>Only let your conuerſation, &amp;c.</hi> it may either bee referred vnto that whereof the Apoſtle ſpake immediately before, and ſo haue this meaning, I ſay I ſhall abide and continue yet with you, for your furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ioy, and reioycing for mee: yet whatſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of mee, <hi>only looke yee to your conuerſation, that it bee ſuch as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt:</hi> Or elſe it may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto all that went before, and ſo haue this meaning; God hath done great things for you, he hath cauſed his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell to be preached vnto you, and brought you vnto the fellowſhip of the Goſpell: he hath begunne a good worke in you, and it is not to be doubted but that he will performe it vntill the day of Chriſt: he hath made you to abound in loue, in knowledge, and in all iudgement: hee hath turned my bands to the furthering of the Goſpell for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and he hath appointed to deliuer me out of bands, and to reſtore mee againe vnto you, for the furtherance and ioy of your faith, and that yee may the more abundantly reioyce in Ieſus Chriſt for mee.

                     </note> like vnto good ſouldiers which yeeld no ground, but keepe their ſtanding, that, I ſay, they ſtood faſt in one ſpirit, that is, that they abode conſtant in one truth of Chriſt by one ſpirit whereinto they had all drunke. 2. That with ioint minds and one accord amongſt themſelues, they fought together for the truth of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aduerſaries of the Goſpell, not with carnall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, but with the faith of the Goſpell, with the ſhield of faith to quench all the fierie darts of the wicked, which here he calleth the faith of the Goſpell, becauſe it commeth by the hearing of the Goſpell preached. And 3. that in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they feared their aduerſaries, but couragiouſly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred them, and patiently endured all wrongs offered by them. If the Apoſtle might heare that thus they ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the truth, not caſt downe by their aduerſaries, that thus with one accord they fought together, and threw down their aduerſaries, that thus couragiouſly they encountred their aduerſaries in nothing fearing them, this might in part ſhew that their conuerſation were ſuch as became the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt. This I take to bee the true meaning of theſe words thus farre. Now, let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence for our farther, vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which here I note, is the Apoſtles exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vnto the Philippians in general, that they ſhould lead ſuch a life, that their conuerſation ſhould be ſuch as became the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus; that as they profeſſed the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, ſo they ſhould lead a life agreeable to the Goſpell of Chriſt. Whence I obſerue that ſo many as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus ought to labour by all meanes to lead a life agreeable to the Goſpell of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Which thing our Apoſtle alſo ſheweth in many other
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:599:137"/> exhortations which he maketh to the like purpoſe, as when he exhorteth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to walke worthy of God who had called them vnto his kingdome and glory.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2 12.</note> Where the Apoſtles meaning is, that as God had vouchſafed them this mercie to call them vnto his kingdome and glory, ſo they were to walke worthy of him, framing their liues as neere as they could vnto his life, who was the engrauen form of his perſon. So that being called by God vnto his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and glory by the preaching of the Goſpell, we are to labour to walke worthy of God in all godlineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. So likewiſe he exhorteth the Epheſians <hi>to walke worthy of the vocation whereunto they were called.</hi> Where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Apoſtles meaning is, that as they were called to be Saints in Chriſt Ieſus, ſo they ſhould walke worthy of that calling, euen as became Saints in Chriſt Ieſus.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1.</note> So that being Saints by calling we are to labour to be Saints in life and conuerſation. As then is our calling; as is our profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo are we to labor to lead a life agreeable to our calling, agreeable to our profeſſion, and profeſſing the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus to lead a life agreeable to the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. And why? The reaſons are very cleare. As 1. that the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus be not euill ſpoken of;<note place="margin">

They that profeſſe the Goſpell of Chriſt, are to labour to liue agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably thereunto, that they may adorne the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus in all thing, and winne others by their holy conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto righteouſneſſe and holineſſe,<note place="margin">

For is it not ſaid of many that make a very great profeſſion of the Goſpell and of religion, that they are hard men, vnmercifull men, men that grinde the faces of the poore, and <hi>ſell the needie for ſhoes,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh?

Alas, beloued, do we not ſee and conſider that thus we make our God to be blaſphemed, our profeſſion to bee ſlandered, and the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus to be euill ſpoken of for our ſakes? Doe we not ſee and conſider that Atheiſt, and Papiſt, and euery earthly minded man makes his van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of theſe things, and thinkes his owne waies well patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by our waies? Doe wee not ſee and conſider, that by ſuch our life and conuerſation the froward and obſtinate are hardened, the weake are offended, and the edge and courage of many much cooled and abated? If ſuch ſpots and ſtaines in our life did only touch our ſelues, yet were we to looke vnto them, becauſe without holineſſe of life no man ſhall ſee the Lord. But when men ſeeing that we make a good profeſſion,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I doubt not but ſuch as obſerue theſe things in vs, and fill their mouthes with talking of them, both are guiltie of as crying ſinnes themſelues, and moſt iniuriouſly taxe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs of theſe things, But the more ready they are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, and to taxe without a cauſe, the more carefull wee are to be that they haue no iuſt cauſe of taxing. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beloued, as we profeſſe the Goſpell of Chriſt, ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to liue as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt. As the Goſpell teacheth vs to be holy, ſo let vs be holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:599:139"/> of conuerſation: as the Goſpell teacheth vs to walke in the light, ſo let vs walke in the light, and haue nothing to do with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe: as the Goſpell teacheth vs to loue God, and one another, ſo let vs loue God aboue all things, and our neighbour as our ſelfe: as the Goſpell is the Goſpell of peace, ſo let vs be at peace with all men: as the Goſpell is true, ſo let vs ſpeake the truth euery man vnto his neighbour, and lie not one vnto another, &amp;c. Otherwiſe wee walke not as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt. In a word, let vs not be hearers or profeſſors of the word onely, but doers alſo of the ſame, leaſt wee deceiue our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Againe, as this note may ſerue for the iuſt reproofe of ſuch as profeſſe well, but liue not ſo well, ſo may it alſo ſerue for a iuſt defence againſt the vniuſt ſlaunder of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who beare the world in hand that holineſſe of life is a matter that we neuer vrge, that wee make no great recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of. Your ſelues haue heard and can witnes how often ſince this very exerciſe hath begunne you haue beene vrged to runne forward in the race of righteouſneſſe, and to make an end of your ſaluation with feare and trembling, to labour to be blameleſſe, and pure, and the ſonnes of God in the middeſt of a naughtie and crooked nation, to haue your conuerſation in heauen, to communicate vnto the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the poore and diſtreſſed Saints, to abound in loue, in knowledge, and in all iudgement, to be filled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe, and to ſtriue to be pure, and without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vntill the day of Chriſt. And now ye heare, that if ye haue fellowſhip in the Goſpell your conuerſation is to bee as it becommeth of Chriſt. Know them therefore to be of their father the Deuill who was a liar from the beginning, and is the father thereof. And ſuffer not your ſelues to bee deceiued by them, who when they cannot otherwiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt the truth fall to ſlaunder the profeſſors of the truth. And let this ſuffice to bee noted from the Apoſtles generall exhortation, whence ye ſee that ſuch as profeſſe the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould labour by all meanes to lead
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:599:140"/> ſuch a life as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But what? will it ſerue the turne for a time in the preſence or company of ſuch and ſuch perſons, to make a ſhew of ſuch a life and conuerſation, as hypocrites doe, which doe all that they doe to pleaſe men? No: and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Let your conuerſation bee as it becommeth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, that whether I come and ſee you, or elſe be abſent, and onely heare of you, I may heart and ſee that in ſinceritie and truth which I deſire.</hi> Whence I obſerue, that the life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of ſuch as profeſſe the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, is to be framed not after the will of man, but after the will of God; not to pleaſe men, but to pleaſe the Lord, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man be preſent or abſent, their life bee ſuch as it ought to be.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                     <hi>If I ſhould pleaſe men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I were not the ſeruant of Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh it of preaching the doctrine of the Goſpell, that if he ſhould apply himſelfe to the humors of men, and preach things pleaſing vnto them, he ſhould not pleaſe God <hi>which tryeth the heart.</hi> But it may alſo very well be applyed vnto the life and conuerſation of men, that if we ſhall only frame our liues vnto mens likings, and for the time only ſeeke to pleaſe them, our life ſhall not be ſuch as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt. And therefore the Lord himſelfe ſharply reproued it in <hi>Ezechiels</hi> hearers, where he ſaith.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>EZek</hi> 33.31</note> 
                     <hi>My people ſit before thee, and heare thy wordes, but they will not doe them: for with their mouthes they make ieaſts, &amp; their heart goeth after their couetouſnes.</hi> Where ye ſee the Lord taxeth <hi>Ezechiels</hi> hearers to bee ſuch, as when hee preached vnto them, ſate as his people, and hearkened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Prophet, &amp; carried themſelues well in his preſence; but in their hearts ranne after their couetouſneſſe, and out of his preſence made but a mocke of all that he ſpake vnto them. And this was one of the ſinnes wherefore the Lord threatned to lay the land deſolate and waſte.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs to beware of hypocriſie. It is not for vs to come vnto this place, here to kneele vs downe on our knees, to knocke our breaſts, to lift vp our eyes vnto Heauen, to ſit, and hearken vnto the Preacher, and when
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:599:140"/> wee goe hence to make a mocke at the things that were ſpoken, or to forget them, or notwithſtanding, whatſoeuer ſhew of godlineſſe we made in the Church, in our houſes to returne vnto our vomite. For what elſe is this but here to play the hypocrites, and here to make a ſhew of godlineſſe, the power whereof at home we denie? And what is vnto hypocrites but a woe? In the ordering therefore of our life let vs not depend vpon mans preſence or abſence, but in a religious feare of the Lord, let euery one of vs ſo walke as becommeth vs, knowing that whether man ſee vs, or ſee vs not, yet God ſeeth vs, and conſidereth all our waies. It is the preſence and pleaſure of the Lord, that wee are to looke vnto. Let our life therefore, and our conuerſation be as in his preſence, and ſuch as may pleaſe him, howſoeuer wee pleaſe or diſpleaſe men. And let this ſuffice to bee noted touching the qualitie of ſuch a conuerſion as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt. Whence ye ſee, that it is not to bee hypocriticall, or framed after mens liking, for the time to pleaſe them, but to be led in the feare of the Lord to pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>But how may we ſo order our conuerſation, that it may be ſuch as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt? That the Apoſtle now ſheweth in the next place, as namely, <hi>if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in one ſpirit, if we ſight together in one mind through the faith of the Goſpell, &amp; if we feare our aduerſaries in nothing. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in one ſpirit,</hi> that is, if we ſtand faſt, and abide conſtant in one truth of Chriſt, by one ſpirit wherinto we are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Whence I obſerue one ſpeciall part of a conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, agreeable to the Goſpell of Chriſt, and that is, conſtant abiding in the truth. If we ſtand faſt, and abide conſtant in the truth, this is one note that our conuerſation is ſuch as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>If ye continue in my word,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>yee are verily my Diſciples:</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, if ye ſtand faſt againſt all aſſaults whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and quit your ſelues like men, and abide conſtant in the truth which I haue taught you, ſo ye ſhew your ſelues to be my Diſciples, and to walke worthie of me. So that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:599:141"/> and abide conſtant in the truth ſhewes vs to be Chriſt his Diſciples, and ſheweth our conuerſation to be ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the Goſpell. Whereupon it is that wee are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten exhorted to continue in the grace of God, to continue in the faith, to abide conſtant in the truth, to ſtand faſt, and ſhrinke not.</p>
                  <p>Beware then, beloued, of reuolting from the truth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye haue byn taught in Chriſt Ieſus, of being caried about with euery winde of doctrine, by the deceit of men, and with craftineſſe, whereby they lye in waite to deceiue: of yeelding, and giuing ground vnto the aduerſaries of the truth. <hi>He that continueth vnto the end, he ſhall be ſaued.</hi> But if ye ſtart aſide like a broken Bowe, ſurely yee walke not as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt. Looke to it then, that ye continue in the things which ye haue learned, and that yee fall not away from the hope of your profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Another thing alſo hence I obſerue, which is, that to continue and abide conſtant in the the truth, is wholly the gift of the holy Ghoſt. It is not by our owne wiſdome, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſtrength; but onely by the power of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that we ſtand faſt, without which we can no more ſtand in the truth, then can our bodies ſtand without our ſoule and ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Both therefore let vs beware, that we grieue not the holy ſpirit by our euill deeds, or by our euill words; and let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies powre out feruent prayers vnto him, that hee will vouchſafe euer to abide with vs, to ſtrengthen vs, to abide in the truth.</p>
                  <p>It followeth, <hi>And in one minde, &amp;c.]</hi> Whence, I obſerue another ſpeciall note of a conuerſation agreeable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt, and that is, vnity and concord, and loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelues. If we be knit together in one minde, ſo that as wee are one bodie in Chriſt Ieſus, ſo wee bee of one heart, and one ſoule, dwelling together as brethren in vnity, loue, &amp; good agreement, this is a good token, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation is ſuch as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Let vs beware then how we nouriſh hatreds, malice, ſtrife, &amp; contention in our ſelues one againſt another. For theſe things doe ſo diſtract vs from another, as that being thus affected one towards another, we doe not walke as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Goſpell of Chriſt; or rather we are iniurious vnto the Goſpell of Chriſt. For thus it commeth to paſſe, that the Goſpell which wee profeſſe is euill ſpoken of. Let vs therefore be knit together in one mind, and beware of euery thing that may diſtract and diſmember vs.</p>
                  <p>Another thing hence I obſerue, which is, that this Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an concorde muſt be to fight together, againſt ſuch aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries as fight againſt the truth, be they heretiques and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques that fight againſt it and vs with lyes, ſlanders, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, falſe doctrines, and the like: or be they tyrants that fight againſt it and vs, with fire, ſword, impriſonment, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, confiſcation of our goods, or the like. Wee are not onely to ſtand ſtoutly and conſtantly for the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, without being throwen downe by them, but being knit together one with another, in one minde we are ioyntly and with one accord to fight together for the truth againſt them, as good Souldiers to throw them downe, that when we haue finiſhed our courſe, we may ſay with our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>That we haue fought a good fight.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7.</note> Otherwiſe we walke not as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Let them then looke to this, that either for eaſe and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or for feare of diſpleaſure ſome way, or vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carnall reaſon whatſoeuer, will rather betray the truth then they will fight for it. And ſeeing none is crowned but hee that ſtriueth lawfully, let vs fight together here, that there we may be crowned.</p>
                  <p>But how are we to fight for the truth againſt the deuill, and all his inſtruments the aduerſaries thereof. Some by praying, ſome by preaching, ſome by writing, ſome by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:599:142"/> continue in one ſpirit, and in one minde fighting &amp;c, and that in nothing yee feare your aduerſaries. For ſo wee are to vnderſtand the Apoſtle, that hauing exhorted the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> to ſuch a conuerſation as becommeth the goſpell of Chriſt, he doth particularly ſpecifie ſome things whereby they might giue proofe vnto him of ſuch a conuerſation, as namely if hee might heare or ſee that they continued in one ſpirit, and in one minde fighting together &amp;c, and in nothing fearing the aduerſaries, or being in nothing afraid of the aduerſaries. Thus then I read theſe words, not by way of dehortation, but as depending on the former words, <hi>and in nothing fearing the aduerſaries,</hi> or, <hi>and being in nothing afraid of the aduerſaries.</hi> The Syriac interpreter rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>in nothing feare our aduerſaries;</hi> our reading is, <hi>in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing feare your aduerſaries.</hi> But in the originall is neither read <hi>our,</hi> nor <hi>your aduerſaries,</hi> but as I ſaid before, <hi>in nothing fearing the aduerſaries,</hi> or <hi>fearing them that oppoſe themſelues.</hi> The meaning is, that if he might heare or ſee that both they ſtood faſt by the power of the ſpirit againſt the aduerſaries of the truth, and that they ioyntly fought together againſt the aduerſaries of the truth, as men knit together in one minde, and likewiſe that in nothing they feared them that oppoſed themſelues againſt the truth, and the profeſſors thereof, this ſhould bee a good proofe vnto him that their converſation was ſuch as became the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence then I obſerue a third ſpeciall part, and marke of ſuch a conuerſation as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt, which is chriſtian courage againſt the aduerſaries of the truth, and of the profeſſors thereof. If in nothing we feare the aduerſaries of the Church, and of the truth, but take a good courage againſt the Dragon and his Angels, this is a good note of ſuch a conuerſation as becommeth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt.

                  <p>For this yee muſt here note and vnderſtand, that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, afflictions, ſufferings, and wrongs by aduerſaries, are in themſelues, and in their owne nature, puniſhments of ſinne, as is alſo death; and hereby God in iuſtice might puniſh our ſinnes and our iniquities: for if hee ſhould bring vpon vs the bloudy perſecutions of ſuch Tyrants as were <hi>Nero, Domitian,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe cruell perſecutors in the Primitiue Church, he might thus plague vs for our of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fences, and himſelfe be iuſt in all his wayes, and holy in all his workes. But vnto vs his beloued ones, and his redeemed, theſe things are not that which in themſelues and in their owne nature they are, and which in Gods iuſtice they might be vnto vs, euen puniſhments of our ſinnes, but onely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly corrections, and louing chaſtiſements, whereby in mercy God exerciſeth vs, repreſſeth ſinne in vs, and bowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the branne of corruption out of vs here in the body of this fleſh. And as vnto vs in mercy death is made of God
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:599:147"/> not that which in it owne nature it is, a puniſhment of ſinne, but an entrance and paſſage vnto life; ſo in mercy hath hee promiſed, that afflictions, perſecutions, and the like, ſhall be vnto vs, not that which in their owne nature are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of greater miſeries, but fore-runners of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the day of Chriſt Ieſus. It is not then of the nature of ſuffering perſecution, yee ſee, but it is of God, that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution betokeneth vnto vs ſaluation, that ſaluation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced vnto vs which are troubled. He in mercy hath promiſed that ſo it ſhall be, and therefore ſo it ſhall be, and it is a righteous thing with him that it be ſo.</p>
                  <p>The vſe which our Apoſtle here teacheth vs to make hereof, is as of the former, not to feare perſecution by the aduerſaries, which oppoſe themſelues againſt the truth, and againſt vs for the truths ſake: for ſeeing God turneth their perſecution, and rage againſt vs, to their perdition, and to our ſaluation, why ſhould wee feare them? Whatſoeuer therefore they practiſe againſt vs, let vs reſt and repoſe our ſelues in our God: He ſhall ſtretch out his hand vpon the furiouſnes of our enemies, but his right hand ſhall ſaue vs: he ſhall recompenſe the aduerſaries their wickednes, and deſtroy them in their owne malice; but hee ſhall wipe all teares from our eyes, and after wee haue drunke of the brooke in the way, lift vp our head aboue all our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
                  <p>Againe, is it of God that perſecution cauſeth vnto vs ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? This then may farther teach vs, that by ſuffering perſecution we doe not merit ſaluation. For if it be of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that our ſufferings bring ſaluation vnto vs, then it is not of God, but the cauſe is in our ſelues: and if it be of God, then is it not of merit, nor is the cauſe of our ſaluation in our ſelues. Not according to the workes which we doe, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings which we ſuffer, but according to his mercy he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs: for neither haue we wherein to reioyce by works, nor are any ſufferings of this preſent time worthy of that glory which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs, nor is there <hi>any other name vnder heauen whereby we may be ſaued, but onely by the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:599:148"/> name of Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> He that reioyceth therefore let him reioyce in the Lord, of whom it is that our perſecutions and ſufferings worke vnto our ſaluation. And let this bee ſpoken of this third motiue or reaſon, whereby yee ſee that we are not to feare the aduerſaries, becauſe God recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their perſecution vnto them with perditi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It followeth; <hi>For vnto you it is giuen &amp;c.]</hi> Theſe words are both a proofe of that which went immediatly before, and a fourth motiue likewiſe to perſwade the Apoſtles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intendment. Immediatly before he had ſaid, that God in perſecution gaue them a token of their ſaluation. The proofe here is: Vnto you it is giuen of God by grace to ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake; therefore in ſuffering God giueth you a token of your ſaluation: or thus, ſufferings for Chriſt are teſtimonies of grace vnto you of God, therefore they are arguments and tokens of ſaluation vnto you of God. And as thus theſe words ſerue for proofe of that, ſo are they a notable motiue to perſwade the <hi>Philippians</hi> not to feare the aduerſaries: for thus out of the Apoſtles words I frame the motiue: Who will be afraid of a ſingular gift of God? but to ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake is a ſingular gift of God to you, therefore yee are not to feare perſecution by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. And that to ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake is a gift of God hee ſheweth <hi>à pari,</hi> from the like; as to beleeue in Chriſt is the gift of God, ſo to ſuffer for Chriſt, both gifts of God, and vnto whom the one is giuen, the other may not ſeeme ſtrange. <hi>For vnto you it is giuen,</hi> to wit by grace, for ſo the word ſignifieth,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Here then firſt I note that the Apoſtle ſaith, it was giuen by grace vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> to beleeue in Chriſt. Whence I obſerue that faith in Chriſt is the gift of God by grace.

As for the reſt that loue darkeneſſe better then light, and vnder this or that pretence whatſoeuer, will not come to heare the worde preached; let them feare, for want of faith and a good conſcience in that day, to heare the word, which wil be too fearefull for them to heare, <hi>Goe yee curſed, &amp;c.</hi> But I proceede to that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I note, is that the Apoſtle ſaith, it was giuen by grace vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> to ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake, not ſimply to ſuffer, but to ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake. Whence I obſerue, that perſecution and ſuffering for Chriſt his ſake, is a gift of God by grace. And this our Sauiour himſelfe ſheweth by thoſe his words vnto <hi>Peter,</hi>

                  <p>Now here ye muſt vnderſtand that all ſufferings are not ſufferings for Chriſt his ſake, and that all that ſay they ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake do not ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake; for ſuch there are as ſuffer as euill doers; touching which ſort of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers the Apoſtle exhorteth vs ſaying, <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a murtherer,</hi>

                     </gap>r in any like reſpects, are no ſufferings for Chriſt his ſake. To ſuffer then for Chriſt his ſake, is with patience to endure mockings, ſcourgings, bonds, impriſonments, and death it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ather then we will depart from him, or preiudice his glorie. And thus to ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake, is a ſingular gift of God by grace, as hath already beene ſhewed; not the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and perſecutions themſelues in themſelues, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hus to ſuffer them.</p>
                  <p>Now the Vſe which our Apoſtle teacheth vs to make hereof is this, not to feare the aduerſaries in any thing. For who would be afraid of a ſingular gift of God? Now to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for Chriſt his ſake by the aduerſaries is a ſingular gift of God. Let vs not therefore in any thing feare our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but take good courage againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this may ſerue to teach vs what nouices yet wee are in the ſchoole of Chriſt; for how many of vs eſteeme it a ſingular gift of God to ſuffer perſecution for Chriſt his ſake? Surely, if we had learned this leſſon well, wee had profited very well in the ſchoole of Chriſt. But when we are taught this leſſon, what doe many of vs, I hope not many here, but in many places what do many ſay within themſelues? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I feare to remember what they ſay. But doe they not ſay, I bid no ſuch gifts, ſuch gifts be farre from mee, let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch gifts on his deareſt children, not on me; and ſuch
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:599:151"/> other blaſphemous ſpeeches, which the godly may feare to heare or vtter? And indeed he giueth no ſuch gifts to ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But let vs know, that then we haue wel profited in the ſchole of Chriſt when we haue well learned this leſſon, that to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his Chriſts ſake is a ſingular gift of God; eſpecially when we haue ſo learned it, that when it comes to the pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctiſe, we can ſo account it.</p>
                  <p>Again, this may teach vs that it is not in our own power, or ſtrength to ſuffer perſecution for Chriſt his ſake, but this muſt be giuen vs of God. To will, to doe, to belieue, to ſuffer, all muſt be giuen of God: he muſt beginne, and hee muſt make an end; he muſt be all in all that hee may haue the glorie of all.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</note> If <hi>Peter</hi> bee left vnto himſelfe a damſell ſhall be enough to terrifie him, and to make him denie his Lord and Maſter. And therefore hee can tell vs out of his owne experience, that wee are kept by the power of God through faith vnto ſaluation. Whether therefore we beliue, or ſuffer for Chriſt his ſake, let vs know that it is giuen vs of God, and let him haue all the glorie of it.</p>
                  <p>Another thing yet I obſerue in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you it is giuen not onely to beleeue, but to ſuffer for Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle hauing in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exhorted the <hi>Philippians</hi> generally vnto ſuch a conuerſation as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Goſpell of Chriſt, and hauing particularly inſtanced in ſome of thoſe points wherein ſuch a conuerſation conſiſteth; now in this chapter hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in ſome other points wherein ſuch a conuerſation conſiſteth, as namely in concord, loue, and humilitie, and moſt earneſtly exhorteth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and in them vs vnto theſe moſt neceſſarie vertues and graces of a Chriſtian life and converſation. In the words I note 1. the manner. 2. the matter of the Apoſtles exhortation. The manner how the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> is by way of requeſt, as we ſay, for all the loues vnder heauen, in the firſt verſe, in theſe words, <hi>If there be therefore &amp;c.</hi> Wherein the Apoſtle coucheth 4. very patheticall arguments to perſwade
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:599:153"/> the things whervnto he exhorteth them, are inferred, as ye ſee, vpon the words before; as if he ſhould haue ſaid, your ſelues haue ſeene what I ſuffered at <hi>Philippi</hi> for Chriſt his ſake, what fighting I had there, and now yee heare what I ſuffer at <hi>Rome</hi> for Chriſt his ſake, what fighting I haue here, <hi>If therefore &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt argument is, <hi>If there be any conſolation in Chriſt,</hi> that is, if by my miniſterie and Apoſtleſhip ye haue any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Chriſt Ieſus, then <hi>fulfill my ioy that yee be like minded &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, now ſhew whether yee haue receiued any conſolation in Chriſt Ieſus by the worke of my miniſterie. If yee haue receiued any, let me haue ſome backe againe from you, <hi>fulfill my ioy &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond argument is, <hi>if there be any comfort of loue,</hi> that is, if you ſo loue me that yee deſire any comfort in theſe my bands for the defence of the Goſpell, then <hi>fulfill my ioy &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid; I loue you from the very heart roote in Ieſus Chriſt, now ſhew whether yee ſo loue me that indeed yee deſire my comfort in my bands and impriſonment. And if yee doe ſo loue me, then <hi>fulfill my ioy &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third argument is, <hi>If there be any fellowſhip of the ſpirit,</hi> that is, if yee be knit together in the bond of one ſpirit with me and amongſt your ſelues, then <hi>fulfill my ioy &amp;c.</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, Men that are knit together in the bond of one ſpirit are to giue proofe thereof by concord, loue, and agreement amongſt themſelues: now then ſhew whether yee be knit together in the bond of one ſpirit with me, &amp; amongſt your ſelues. And if yee be ſo knit together, then <hi>fulfill my ioy &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth argument is, <hi>if there be any compaſſion and mercy,</hi> that is, if ye haue any bowels of compaſſion to ſhew any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to me the Lord his priſoner for your ſake, then <hi>fulfill my ioy &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, Now ſhew what bowels of compaſſion there are in you, what mercy you haue on me the priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt for your ſake. And if there bee any bowels of compaſſion in you, any mercy towards me, then <hi>fulfill my ioy &amp;c.</hi> What more patheticall to moue, more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perſwade then theſe arguments ſo cloſely followed, and ſo paſſionately vrged. All ſuch, and in ſuch ſort preſſed that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:599:153"/> the manner of the Apoſtles exhortation could not be deuiſed more effectuall, to perſwade the things which now his hearts deſire was to perſwade.</p>
                  <p>Now the matter of the Apoſtles exhortation, is partly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching graces which he wiſheth them to follow after, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching faults which hee wiſheth them to bee free from. The graces which he wiſheth them to follow after in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe are ſet downe firſt in generall, and then in ſpeciall. In generall he exhorteth them that they <hi>be like minded;</hi> or as it is tranſlated elſewhere, that they <hi>be like affectioned,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16.</note> hauing their affections, likings, and deſires ſet on the ſame things. Which his exhortation is not ſimply ſo that they <hi>be like minded,</hi> but with another prefixed motiue as I take it therevnto, <hi>fulfill my ioy that yee be like minded.</hi> Which is as if he ſhould haue ſaid, I ioy in the fellowſhip which yee haue in the Goſpell from the firſt day vnto now, I ioy in your conſtant abiding in the truth in ſuch aſſaults by the aduerſaries of the truth, I ioy in your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie ſent vnto me whereby yee communicated to mine afflictions, I ioy in very many mercies and graces of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon you in Chriſt Ieſus. But yet my ioy is not full, ſo long as I heare of any contentions, emulations, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions among you, my ioy is not full. <hi>If therefore there be any conſolation in Chriſt &amp;c, fulfill my ioy,</hi> make full my ioy; and ſo ſhall yee make full my ioyt if yee <hi>be like minded,</hi> like affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one towards another. So that yee ſee the exhortation is not ſimply propoſed, but with this motiue prefixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, my ioy is not full except yee be like minded; fulfill my ioy that ye be like minded. This is the generall vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he exhorteth them.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall vertues compriſed vnder this generall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he exhorteth them are, 1. that they haue the ſame loue, that is, that they loue the ſame things in the Lord. 2. That they be of one accord, that is, that they agree in their wills and deſires in the Lord. 3. That they be of one iudgement, that is, that they agree in the doctrine and truth of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Theſe be the things which he wiſheth to be in them, that their conuerſation may be ſuch as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt; in generall, to be like affectioned in the Lord; in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:599:154"/> ſpeciall to loue the ſame things in the Lord, to agree in their wills and deſires in the Lord, to agree in the doctrine and truth of Chriſt Ieſus. Now the faults which hee wiſheth them to be free from are contention, vaine-glory, and ſelfe-loue noted in the verſes following, yet ſo that the countre-poyſon of humilitie is therein countre-ballanced and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>that nothing be done through contention &amp;c.</hi> This I take to be the order and meaning of theſe words thus farre. Now let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence for our owne farther vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If there be therfore any conſolation in Chriſt Ieſus]</hi> In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Apoſtles exhortation, 1. In generall I note the Apoſtles vehement obteſtation of the <hi>Philippians</hi> for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of concord, loue, and humilitie, that they may neuer faile from amongſt them. He mought, as hee ſaith to <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, haue commaunded them in Chriſt that which were conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8.</note> Yet hee rather beſeecheth them; but that hee doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thorowly, euen for all the loues ſakes vnder heauen, if there be any conſolation in Chriſt in them, any comfort of loue in them, &amp;c. Whence I obſerue, in what manner the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ought to labour to repreſſe ſuch enormities amongſt their people, as hinder the courſe of a Chriſtian conuerſation: they are earneſtly to beſeech them; euen as if they deſired no other recompence of their labors and trauels amongſt them, then this, that ſuch and ſuch contentions might be taken vp, ſuch and ſuch diſorders might bee reformed, ſuch and ſuch Chriſtian pietie might bee maintained. They are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that they are fathers to their flockes, as the Apoſtle calleth himſelfe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1.</note> and as <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo implieth when hee ſaith, <hi>my babes, little children, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore they are to deale with them as parents with their children. Now the father if happily his children be at oddes amongſt themſelues, what doth he? He calleth them vnto him, hee remembreth them what care hee hath had ouer them, what coſt hee hath beene at with them, what his loue hath beene towards them, what his deſire hath beene of their good, what honour, duety, reuerence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience they owe vnto him, and at length entreateth them that if they haue any care of theſe things, if they deſire his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:599:154"/> comfort, if they will not bring his life downe vnto the duſt with griefe, they will be reconciled, and liue together as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in vnitie. Euen ſo Paſtors which are ſpirituall fathers, when their people, their children fall to inconueniences which any way breede offence, they are to remember them with what care they labour amongſt them, how they long after their good from the very heart roote in Ieſus Chriſt; what continuall mention they make of them in their praiers vnto the Lord: what honour againe, duetie, reuerence, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they owe vnto them as vnto them that watch for their ſoules, and at length earneſtly to beſeech them that if they haue any care of theſe things, if they deſire his continuance with comfort amongſt them, if they wiſh that he may giue vp his accounts for them in that day with ioy, &amp; not with griefe, then they will reforme ſuch and ſuch diſorders, liue in ſuch and ſuch ſort as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. Our Apoſtle dealing thus with the <hi>Philippians</hi> in this place, hath therein left a patterne for all Paſtors, that they ſhould ſo deale with their people as they haue him for example.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be you will ſay, that you could like this well, that in things conuenient for you, Paſtors would thus mildly deale with you, as parents with their children. But forſooth, they will rather commaund as Maſters ouer ſeruants, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes threaten the law; they will when things are amiſſe, and this yee cannot brooke. Will ye then haue vs to beſeech you, &amp; mildly to deale with you as here the Apoſtle dealt with the <hi>Philippians?</hi> If ye doe not, it is becauſe ye are not as were the <hi>Philippians.</hi> Be ye as were the <hi>Philippians</hi> generally, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, bee conſtant in the faith of Chriſt Ieſus, be patient in afflictions for Chriſt Ieſus his ſake, communicate to the afflictions of the Saints of Chriſt Ieſus, loue them that labour amongſt you and are euer in the Lord, amongſt many graces of the ſpirit let there be but ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the fleſh, and ſee whether we will not beſeech you, and deale with you as here the Apoſtle dealt with theſe <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lippians.</hi> But if ye be like vnto the <hi>Galathians,</hi> vnſtable ſoules caried about with euery winde of doctrine, corrupt in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, corrupt in manners, then yee may looke for it, that as
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:599:155"/> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſharply rebuked them, ſaying, <hi>O fooliſh Galatians who hath bewitched you that yee ſhould not obey the truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.</note> ſo we will learne of him ſharply to reproue you. This ye muſt know that we may come vnto you either with a rodde,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Philem.</hi> 8.</note> or in loue, and in the ſpirit of meekneſſe; that in Chriſt, we may command you that which is conuenient for you, euen when for loues ſake we rather beſeech you. If we come then vnto you with a rod, or if we commaund you, we do that we may doe, but ye driue vs vnto it by your inordinate waies, and diſſolute liues, which as cankred ſores neede ſharpe corraſiues. For this is a thing, ye heare, which we vrge and preſſe, that paſtors are to labour to repreſſe ſuch enormities as ariſe amongſt their people in the mildeſt ſort that may be, earneſtly beſeeching them to reform ſuch things as are amiſſe. And againe, if we come vnto you for loues ſake beſeeching you, we remit of that wee may doe, euen becauſe in all louing kindneſſe, and meekneſſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we would reconcile you vnto God, and ioyne you vnto the things that belong vnto your peace. For therfore we beſeech you, that by mildneſſe we may preuaile in that wherin of right we may command.</p>
                  <p>But this withall ye muſt note, that our beſeeching of you is to be vnto you as if we commanded you. For when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.1.2.</note> we beſeech you, brethren, <hi>by the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by our aſſembling vnto him, that ye be not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moued from your mind &amp;c.</hi> What elſe is his beſeeching of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> but an adiuration of them by theſe things, that they be not troubled about the day of the Lord his comming. And, not to ſtand vpon many places, when our Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> What elſe is this, but an adiuration of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> by theſe things, that they like minded, &amp;c. Albeit therefore wee are to remit of that which we may do, and of that which ſometimes ye conſtraine vs to doe, and not to threaten, or command, but only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you in Chriſt Ieſus, yet are ye to take our beſeeching of you as a commandement vnto you, euen as a deepe charge touching the things whereof we beſeech you.</p>
                  <p>Let this then, beloued, teach you how ye ought for your parts to carie your ſelues towards your Paſtors and Teachers.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:599:155"/> Are we in all mildneſſe and meekneſſe of ſpirit to deale with you as parents with their children? Then are you in all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as children, to hearken vnto vs as your fathers in Chriſt Ieſus. Are we for loues ſake to beſeech you the things which in Chriſt we might commaund you? Then are yee when wee beſeech you, to take it as if we commanded, as if we charged you, and more to be moued therewith then if we commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then if wee charged you. Of many of you I am ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the Paſtor ſhall not be more readie to deale with you as a father, then ye will be ready to carry your ſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him as children, and that his beſeeching of you ſhall be as if he commanded, as if he charged you. But for ſome, to what purpoſe is it to beſeech them to reforme any thing that is amiſſe in them? Whether in Chriſt his ſteed wee beſeech them, or in his name we commaund them, or out of the law we threaten them, they will not come to heare vs, they will none of our inſtructions. But I leaue them vnto him vnto whom they ſtand or fall. And I beſeech you, beloued, by the mercies of God to continue in the grace wherein yee ſtand, rooted and built in Chriſt, and ſtabliſhed in the faith as yee haue been taught in Chriſt Ieſus. And let this ſuffice to bee obſerued in generall from the manner of the Apoſtles exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; whereby ye ſee the manner how Paſtors ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keepe their people in holy duties, and to repreſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders amongſt them, and that is, by beſeeching them in all meekeneſſe of ſpirit for all loues ſake to doe that which is conuenient.</p>
                  <p>Now in particular, from ſo many arguments, as are couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the manner of the exhortation, may ſo many ſundrie obſeruations be gathered. His firſt argument is, if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, i. If ye haue receiued any conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by my miniſterie and Apoſtleſhip, then fulfill my ioy that ye be like minded, &amp;c. The ground of which argument is, that if the Philippians had receiued comfort in Chriſt by him, then ought they likewiſe at his requeſt thus to comfort him as to be like minded, &amp;c. Whence I obſerue that vnto whom conſolation in Chriſt is miniſtred, of him, he that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred it, may require and looke for the like againe. For the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:599:156"/> generall, it is ſo commonly held, that it is the ſaying of euery man, that one good turne requires an other, and a pleaſure ſhewed requires the like againe. And for the proofe of this particular, that of the Apoſtle is not impertinent: where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor</hi> 9.11.</note> 
                     <hi>If we haue ſowne vnto you ſpirituall things, is it a great thing if we reape your carnall things?</hi> Out of the generall meaning whereof, this particular may not vnfitly bee gathered, that where ſpirituall conſolation in Chriſt Ieſus hath been beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there as other things, ſo comfort, againe, as it is required may iuſtly be expected.</p>
                  <p>Wretched then is that vnthankfulneſſe where hatred is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for good-will, and where the comfort which was mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred is requited with cauſe of heauineſſe. And yet what more common than ſuch vnthankfulneſſe? The Miniſters labours for the conſolation of his people in Chriſt Ieſus, are in too too many places requited with too too great cauſe of heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let the faithfull miniſter now ſay vnto him that hath receiued great comfort in Chriſt Ieſus by his labours, if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if you haue receiued any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Chriſt Ieſus by my miniſterie, let me beſeech you that you ſet not your affections ſo much on things which are on the earth, that you will bridle your inordinate deſires which runne too much after couetouſneſſe, that you will not lend your mony vpon vſurie, &amp;c. And how ſeldome doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this comfort from them againe thus to preuaile with him? Nay to his great griefe hee findeth that his words are not eſteemed. Let it not be ſo with you beloued, but by whoſe labours ye haue receiued comfort in Chriſt Ieſus, let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this comfort againe from you, that their holy deſires may preuaile with you.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond argument is, <hi>If there be any comfort of loue,</hi> that is, if yee ſo loue mee, that ye deſire my comfort in my bonds, for the defence of the Goſpell, then <hi>fulfill my ioy, &amp;c.</hi> The ground of which argument is, that if the <hi>Philippians</hi> loued him as he loued them, and in their loue of him deſired his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his bonds, then they ſhould fulfill his ioy, &amp;c. Whence I obſerue, that to yeeld vnto the holy deſires one of another, is an effectuall token of Chriſtian loue in one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:599:156"/> 
                     <hi>If yee loue mee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>keepe my Commandements.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15</note> Which place ſheweth, that ſo we make proofe of our loue of God, if we conforme our ſelues in obedience to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. But more direct to our very purpoſe is that of our Apoſtle, where he ſaith to <hi>Philemon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Philem.</hi> 17.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou count our things common, receiue him as my ſelfe.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid, Let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his be a token of thy loue towards mee, and that thou coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt all mine thine, and thine mine, euen to yeeld to my deſire, to receiue <hi>Oneſimus</hi> as my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>This then in part ſheweth, why it is that we yeeld not to the holy deſires of ſuch as would gladly haue comfort of our good, euen for want of loue of them. If ſinners ſhall entice vs, and ſay, <hi>Come with vs, wee will lay wait for bloud,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.10.11.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and lie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily for the innocent, without a cauſe, wee will ſwallow them vp aliue like a graue, euen whole, as thoſe that goe downe to the pit, &amp;c.</hi> we are ready enough to yeeld our ſelues vnto their willes, and to runne as faſt as they for their liues vnto miſchiefe. But let the Paſtor ſay to his people, If yee ſo loue mee, that ye deſire my comfort, prophane not the Lord his Sabboths, breake off your ſinnes by righteouſneſſe, and your iniquities by mercy towards the poore; or the father to the childe, If thou ſo loue mee, that thou deſire my comfort, refraine thy feet from euery euill path, and walke in the wayes of the Lord; or the friend vnto his friend, If thou ſo loue me, that thou deſire my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, bridle thine inordinate deſires, flie from that which is euill, and doe that is good: what cares the people for the comfort of their Paſtor in this caſe, or the childe for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his father, or the friend for the comfort of his friend? Will any of them, for the loue of them, that they may bee comforted by them, yeeld vnto their holy deſires? Nay wee loue them not ſo, but whatſoeuer become of their comfort, wee will follow our owne wayes. If it be ſo with vs, this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a fault amongſt vs, and let vs hereafter ſo loue the godly, whatſoeuer be their place, that wee make reckoning of their comfort, and in token thereof, let vs hearken to ſuch holy aduice as they giue vs.</p>
                  <p>His third argument is, <hi>If there be any fellowſhip of the ſpirit;</hi> that is, if yee be knit together in the bond of one ſpirit, and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:599:157"/> haue fellowſhip one with another, as members of one body, vnder one head, then <hi>fulfill my ioy, &amp;c.</hi> The ground of which argument is, that men knit together in the bond of one ſpirit, are to giue proofe thereof by concord, loue, and agreemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> amongſt themſelues. Whence I obſerue, that wee are to giue proofe of being knit together in the bond of one ſpirit, by the bond of peace, concord, and loue amongſt our ſelues. Thus where it is ſaid in the <hi>Acts,</hi> of ſuch as were brought to the faith through the Apoſtles preaching, that they beleeued and were baptized, as a token and proofe, that they were all baptized into one ſpirit, it is alſo ſaid, that they continued together with one accord, that they were of one heart, and of one ſoule <hi>All that beleeued</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luke) were in one place,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>and had all things common.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">41.46.</note> 
                     <hi>And they ſold their poſſeſſions and goods, and parted them to all men, as euery one had need. And they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, &amp;c.</hi> All which things are ſet downe as tokens and proofes, that they were all baptized into one ſpirit. And againe, <hi>The whole multitude of them that beleeued, were of one heart, and of one ſoule;</hi> that is, of one minde, will, conſent, and affection: whereby they ſhewed indeed, that they were knit together in one ſpirit, and had fellowſhip one with another, as members of one head; and therein left vs an example how wee ſhould ſhew that wee are ſo knit, that wee haue ſuch fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p>What proofe then we giue that we are knit together in one ſpirit, and haue fellowſhip one with another, as members of one body, let our contentions, diſcords, and diuiſions, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto the world. Indeed they doe too too plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto our faces, that herein wee are carnall, and walke not as they that are knit together in the fellowſhip of the ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the words following wil giue vs further occaſion to ſpeake of this point.</p>
                  <p>His fourth argument is, <hi>If there be any compaſſion and mercy;</hi> that is, if yee haue any bowels of compaſſion to ſhew any mercy vnto mee the Lord his priſoner for your ſake, <hi>fulfill my ioy, &amp;c.</hi> The ground of which argument is, that in mercy and compaſſion towards him, the Lord his priſoner for their ſake, they ſhould at his requeſt <hi>fulfill his ioy, to be like, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:599:157"/> Whence I obſerue, that the godly requeſts of Gods Saints afflicted for Chriſt his ſake, ſhould moue in vs ſuch bowels of compaſſion, as that wee ſhould gladly hearken and yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Hereupon our Apoſtle, before diuers exhortations and requeſts which he maketh in his Epiſtles, prefixeth this, that hee was priſoner in the Lord, priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>I therefore being priſoner in the Lord,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1.</note> 
                     <hi>pray you that yee walke worthy of that vocation whereunto yee are called.</hi> Where, in that he ſaith, <hi>I being priſoner in the Lord,</hi> he thereby impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they were the rather to hearken vnto his exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it was the exhortation of him that was priſoner for the Lord his cauſe. And ſo hee beginneth his Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon</hi> thus, <hi>Paul a priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> implying that <hi>Philemon</hi> was the rather to hearken and to yeeld to his requeſt for his ſeruant <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> becauſe it was the requeſt of him that was now priſoner for Ieſus Chriſt. I omit other places. By theſe yee ſee how powerfull and effectuall the godly requeſts of Gods afflicted members ought to be with vs.</p>
                  <p>And it were well, that in all places they were ſo powerfull and effectuall, as to ſtirre vp the very bowels of compaſſion towards them. But are not many in many places rather rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to adde affliction vnto their bonds? Would it not now be enough to reiect the requeſts, were they neuer ſo godly, if they ſhould come in the name of the priſoner of the Lord, I the priſoner of the Lord, pray you that yee reforme the wickedneſſe of your wayes? Indeed wee may well wiſh in our daies, that enioying our libertie, we may beſeech you in Chriſt his ſtead: for I feare that if out of our priſons &amp; bonds wee ſhould thus write vnto you, If there bee any compaſſion and mercy in you towards mee the Lord his priſoner, hearken vnto mee in this, that yee be like minded, or the like, I ſay, I feare mee the mention of our bonds would not much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with you, or moue any bowels of compaſſion in you. Well, howſoeuer it would, it ſhould, and I hope it will in all that belong to Chriſt Ieſus. And let this ſuffice to be obſerued from the ſeuerall arguments couched in the manner of the Apoſtles exhortation.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the matter of the Apoſtles exhortation,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:599:158"/> which is this in generall, that they be like minded. Which is not ſimply propoſed, but with this motiue prefixed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, My ioy, though for great cauſe it be great, yet is not full, vnleſſe yee be like minded. <hi>Fulfill my ioy, that yee be like min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Whence I obſerue, firſt, that the godly Paſtors ioy is to be in the weale of his people, whatſoeuer his owne caſe bee. If himſelfe bee, as <hi>Paul</hi> here was, cloſe in priſon, bound with chaines, and looke for nothing but ſentence of death, yet if his people be well, if they ſtand faſt in the faith, hee is to bee glad, and reioyce euen in his bonds. When our Apoſtle wrote to <hi>Philemon,</hi> hee was in priſon, as euen now wee heard: yet ſaith he to him, <hi>wee haue great ioy and conſolation in thy loue, becauſe by thee the Saints hearts are comforted.</hi> So how hard ſoeuer the Paſtors owne caſe be, yet if hee bee a good one, hee hath great ioy and conſolation in his peoples weale.</p>
                  <p>But too too many Paſtors wee haue in our day, which if themſelues be well, care not in what caſe their people bee. If they haue the fleece from them, their hearts are glad, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer become of them. But ſuch reioycing is not good, and ſhall be bitterneſſe in the end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence I obſerue, that the good Paſtors ioy is not to be full ſo long as any thing is amiſſe amongſt his people. Wee ſhall not now need other proofe than this of our Apoſtle in this place. The <hi>Philippians</hi> had embraced the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, they abounded in knowledge and in iudgement, they ſtood faſt in the faith, notwithſtanding their aſſaults by falſe Apoſtles, they were carefull ouer him, and communicated to his afflictions, they were excellent in many graces. So that our Apoſtle had great cauſe to haue great ioy ouer them. But becauſe of ſome contention and vaine-glory amongſt them, his ioy was not full. A ſufficient preſident for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, that he count not his ioy full, ſo long as any thing is amiſſe amongſt his people.</p>
                  <p>Which may ſerue to admoniſh the Paſtor, to labour that nothing may bee amiſſe amongſt his people, either touching life or doctrine, that ſo his ioy may be full, and that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be the crowne of his reioycing in the preſence of our
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:599:158"/> Lord Ieſus Chriſt at his comming. But I come vnto that which the Apoſtle exhorteth in generall.</p>
                  <p>The thing which the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> in generall, is, that they be like minded, that is, like affectioned, hauing their affections, likings, and deſires ſet on the ſame things. An euident argument, that they were not like min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as alſo the reſt which followeth is, that ſome things were amiſſe amongſt them. And in that hee dealeth ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly with them, that theſe things might bee amended in them, it ſheweth that theſe are things which are carefully to be procured, regarded, and maintained.</p>

                  <p>Whence I obſerue in generall, what the ſtate euen of the beſt reformed Churches, and ſo of the moſt holy men is: no Church ſo reformed, no men ſo ſanctified, but that many things are amiſſe amongſt them; though many things bee much to be commended in them, yet ſome things likewiſe are ſtill to be reformed in them. Looke into all thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vnto which our Apoſtle wrote his Epiſtles: yee ſhall not finde any of them ſo commended for embracing the truth, and for ſtanding faſt in the truth, as this Church of <hi>Philippi.</hi> Hee giueth indeed teſtimonie vnto the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that they were ſometimes ſuch as (if it had beene poſſible) would haue pluckt out their owne eyes, and haue giuen them vnto him: ſo loued they him, and the truth which he taught.

Yet here ye ſee, that ſome things were amiſſe amongſt them. Againe, looke into thoſe ſeuen Churches, vnto which <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and there yee ſhall ſee that ſome were fallen, others decayed, ſome were proud, others negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Of all the reſt of thoſe Churches, the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> and the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> are there moſt commended. Yet in both thoſe Churches, by the right vnderſtanding of thoſe Epiſtles that were written to them, it will appeare that there were ſome amongſt them, who profeſſed themſelues to be good Chriſtians, whereas indeed they were no better than a Synagogue and ſinke of Satan. Againe, looke into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches euer ſince that time vnto this day, and at this day, and ſtill yee ſhall ſee, that as in thoſe ſeuen Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo in theſe there were and are, as many things to bee
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:599:160"/> commended, ſo likewiſe many things to be reprehended. And ſo long as the Church is militant vpon earth, it cannot be but that ſhee ſhould be blacke; blacke I ſay not onely in reſpect of her afflictions whereby her beloued doth ſometimes proue her, and ſometimes chaſtiſe her, but blacke alſo in reſpect of her blemiſhes, imperfections, and ſinnes which are the cauſes of her afflictions. For all men while they carry about with them the earthly houſe of this tabernacle, vnto what degree of perfection in faith, knowledge, or other graces of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo euer they be growne, had ſtill neede to pray, <hi>O Lord in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creaſe our faith, our knowledge </hi> and vnto what perfection in innocencie, obedience, or the like they be growne, yet ſtill they are taught to pray, <hi>O Lord forgiue vs our debts and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes.</hi> For here <hi>we know in part,</hi> we beleeue in part, we loue in part, we obey in part, and our greateſt perfection is but great imperfection <hi>whiles we liue here at home in the bodie,</hi>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:599:161"/> Here <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> will bee ſometimes at variance, here <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> will ſometimes not be of one accord, here <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> will ſometimes not be of one iudgement; here we ſhall haue our falls, we ſhall haue our imperfections what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we be. Only in the Citie which is aboue ſhall all teares be wiped from our eyes, all wanes ſupplied, all imperfections perfited, all ſinne ceaſe, and all enemies be vtterly deſtroyed: only there our knowledge, our iudgment, our loue, our peace, our ioy ſhall be perfit. How ſhould we not long then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue out of the bodie, and to dwell with the Lord?

Let vs, beloued, remember that here the beſt of vs haue our blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and that when it is it the beſt with vs, we are but in the way vnto that which is beſt of all for vs; that the beſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church on earth is not thorowly reformed, and that the moſt ſanctified man on earth is but onely in part ſanctified: And let vs make this benefit hereof daily more and more to grow out of loue with this life, and in loue with that life in which there ſhall be no more death; daily more and more to weyne our ſelues from the vanities of Ieruſalem which is on earth, where many things will be done through contention, and vaine-glory, and to haue our <hi>conuerſation in heauen,</hi> where we ſhall all <hi>be like minded, hauing the ſame minde, and being of one accord, and of one iudgement.</hi> And let this ſuffice to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in generall from the matter of the Apoſtles exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby ye ſee the ſtate euen of the beſt reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſo of the moſt holy men, and what vſe is to be made of the imperfections which follow the moſt perfit in this life. Now let vs come vnto the ſeuerall points whereunto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle exhorteth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and in them vs.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing wherevnto hee exhorteth them is, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that they <hi>be like minded,</hi> or <hi>like affectioned,</hi> as the ſame phraſe is tranſlated elſe where,<note place="margin">

So that when he exhorteth them to <hi>be like min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> it is in generall that their affections be ſet on the ſame things, louing the ſame things, according in deſire of the ſame things, and according in iudgment of the ſame things, but all in the Lord. Whence I obſerue a neceſſarie dutie in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians called to the knowledge of God by the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, which is that they <hi>be like minded in the Lord,</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their affections, likings, and deſires on the ſame things in the Lord. A duty which our Apoſtle preſcribeth almoſt as oft as any other duty.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.</note> In the beginning of his former to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians he beſeecheth them by the name of our Lord Ieſus Christ, that they all ſpeake one thing, and that they be knit together in one minde, and in one iudgement.</hi> Where yee ſee he beſeecheth them and in them vs, euen by the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to be all of one minde; and becauſe diſagreeing in words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth diſſenſion of minde, therefore that wee may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be all of one minde, hee beſeecheth vs all to ſpeake one thing.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:599:162"/> of <hi>Corinth</hi> was troubled? Was it not becauſe they were not like minded in the Lord? One held of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> one of <hi>Cephas,</hi> another of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> one would pray and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie bare-headed, another with his head couered, and when they came vnto the Lord his Supper one was hungry, and another was drunken. And how can it bee but that there ſhould bee diſſenſions and contentions, when one likes this, and another that, one would haue this, and another that, one drawes this way, and another that way? In a little houſe, yee know, if the husband be of one minde, and the wife of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; the Parents of one minde, and the children of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; the maſter of one minde, and the ſeruants of another, and euery of them will needs follow their owne minde, and fancie their owne way, how troubled muſt needs that houſe be? And therefore our bleſſed Sauiour being now ready to be offered, in that holy praier for all his children praied, that <hi>we might be all one euen as He and the Father were one,</hi>

If then we will walke as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt, we are not onely to bee ioyned in one faith, and in hope, but in all things wee are to be like minded one towards another accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſt Ieſus; we are to loue and like, affect and fancie, will and deſire the ſame things as they are pleaſing vnto the Lord; being at one with God, wee are to be of one minde amongſt our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Here then our aduerſaries will aske of vs, if this be ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie a dutie, how happens it that ye are not all like minded? What meane the tearmes of Zuinglians, Lutheranes,<note place="margin">Bez. epiſt. <hi>5.</hi>

Firſt therefore, let them plucke out the beame of their owne eye that ſo they may ſee clearely the mote which is in our eie, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> them cleare the point that they are like minded amongſt themſelues, and then let them tell vs that we are not all of one minde.</p>
                  <p>But how doe they ſhew that wee are not all of one minde? If ye be, ſay they, then what meane the tearmes of Zuinglians, Lutherans, Caluiniſts, amongſt you? But I ſay vnto them, what doe they meane to note vs by ſuch tearmes? The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of theſe men we honour and reuerence, as alſo we doe other notable lights which haue beene in the Church, and are at this day. But if we be named after any other name then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name of Chriſt Ieſus, it is through their malice not by our deſire. Yea, but how is it ſay they, that ſome amongſt you are Browniſts, ſome Baroiſts, ſome Puritans, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that touching ceremonies, and outward diſcipline
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:599:163"/> there is ſuch difference amongſt you? I anſwere, that if there be any Browniſts or Baroiſts amongſt vs wee hold them not to be of vs, and therefore their diſtraction from vs ought not to be obiected vnto vs. Now for our difference about cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and outward diſcipline, I wiſh we were all like minded in theſe things, and it is a fault and blemiſh of ſome in our Church, that we are not like minded in theſe things. But for the ſubſtance of doctrine, and grounds of religion wherein is it that we are not like minded? If they could, no doubt they would taxe vs in the ſubſtance as they doe in the accident; and as they cannot in the ſubſtance, ſo I wiſh they could not taxe vs in the accident. So ſhould the ioy of our <hi>Sion</hi> be full, if we were all like minded, both for the ſubſtance, and for the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſo many as loue the peace of <hi>Sion,</hi> and wiſh her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, pray alſo that this her ioy may be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this may ſerue to reproue a fault too too common amongſt vs. For if we be ioined together in one faith, and in one hope, if we agree in the ſubſtance of truth, we thinke it a ſmall matter to diſſent amongeſt our ſelues about ſmaller matters. And indeed it is the leſſe matter. But yet it is a thing which we ought to labour, euen to be like minded in the Lord in all things. Which our Apoſtle ſufficiently ſheweth when in his exhortations vnto vs to be like minded, he doth not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vs vnto theſe or theſe things, but indefinitely hee would haue vs to be like minded, according to Chriſt Ieſus. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, and in matters of ceremonie, in matters of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and in matters of diſcipline, in matters of life, and in matters of learning, in matters of religion, and in matters of ciuill conuerſation he would haue vs to be like minded, as in the Lord it may be warranted.

If we agree in our wills and deſires in the Lord. And 3. if we be of one iudgement, i. If we agree in one truth of Chriſt Ieſus. For theſe the particulars are as I take it compriſed vnder, and meant in that generall; ſo that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we thus loue and agree in the Lord then are wee like minded in the Lord, and our conuerſation in a great part is ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the Goſpell of Chriſt. Becauſe I haue ſtood long vpon the generall, I ſhall the leſſe neede to ſtand vpon theſe particulars, which in effect haue beene handled in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Briefly therefore of theſe as time will giue leaue.</p>
                  <p>The 1. thing then, which in theſe particulars I note is, that the Apoſtle would haue them to haue the ſame loue, the ſame I ſay, in reſpect of the obiect, that they ſhould loue the ſame things, the ſame Church, the ſame Goſpell, the ſame truth euen as we ſay that they haue the ſame faith, who belieue in the ſame Chriſt. Hence then I obſerue, that if we will be like minded, and walke as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> muſt we loue the ſame things in the Lord, not one one thing and another an other thing, but the ſame things, as ſimply the ſame things. For we may loue the ſame things, and yet be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> from that loue of the ſame things which becommeth vs, as namely, if we loue the ſame delights of the fleſh, the ſame ſins or corruptions whatſoeuer; but the ſame things in the Lord and in the loue whereof hee is delighted, and well pleaſed. Thus it is commaunded vs euery where in the booke of God that we all loue the ſame God, the ſame truth, the ſame meanes of our ſaluation in Chriſt, and generally the ſame things whatſoeuer they be that belong vnto our peace. And the reaſon of it is plaine. For where one loues one thing, and another another thing; as for example, one Chriſt, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antichriſt, when one hateth that which another loueth; where euery man loues that which himſelfe liketh, and ſcarce two loue the ſame things, what loue can there be, nay what diſtractions muſt there not needes be, nay what deſolation are not likely to enſue? In the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> they loued not the ſame things, but one loued this man, another that ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:599:164"/> and what diſſentions bred it in that Church? In our neighbor kingdome of <hi>France</hi> they loue not the ſame things, but one ſort loue the light of the word, another ſort loue darkeneſſe better then light, and what bloud hath it ſhedde in that king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome? Amongſt our ſelues we loue not the ſame things in the Lord, but one ſort loue their pleaſures, another ſort their profits, another ſort their promotions, the feweſt ſort the things that they ſhould loue, and what but a iudgement like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enſue?</p>
                  <p>Nay beloued here is the miſerie, and like to be the ruine of our Land, in our Land wee loue not the ſame things in the Lord, but we loue too many of vs that man of ſinne, and the poyſoned cuppes of the fornications of that whore, and too few of vs the ſimplicitie of the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, to ſpeake plainely we loue too many of vs the Pope and his marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and too few of vs Chriſt and his truth, we ſpeake not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Beloued, if we will not for the loue of the Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the holy Ghoſt hath commanded vs, yet for the loue of our owne liues, and that we be not made a prey vnto our enemies, let vs loue the ſame truth of Chriſt Ieſus, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the ſame things in the Lord. Let vs no longer halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and <hi>Baal,</hi> Chriſt and Antichriſt, religion and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; but with religious hearts let vs loue the ſame truth, the ſame God, the ſame things in the Lord, that ſome may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ike minded according to Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>The 2. thing which in theſe particulars I note is, that the Apoſtle would haue the <hi>Philippians</hi> to be of one accord, i. to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whence I obſerue another neceſſarie dutie for vs that we be like minded, and walke as becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt, and that is, that we agree in our wills and deſires in the Lord, that vnitie and concord amongſt vs bee preſerued and maintained. To agree in miſchiefe we are ready enough, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:599:165"/> neede we any to moue vs thereunto. For, as it is in the Prophet,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>how good and ioyfull a thing it is brethren to dwell together in vnity,</hi> i. to liue together in that concord, and good agreement which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Lord. And the more to ſhew the precious worth of holy agreement amongſt the ſonnes of God, be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it vnto the oyntment preſcribed for <hi>Aaron,</hi> which was ſo ſweete that when <hi>Aaron</hi> was annointed therewith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ex.</hi> 30.23.</note> the ſmell of it was moſt pleaſant vnto all that were by. And euen ſo ſweete and pleaſant a thing it is to ſee brethren to be of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Lord. This is that which is commended in the faithfull in the Acts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32.</note> 
                     <hi>that they were of one heart, and of one ſoule agreeing in their mindes, wills, deſires, and affections.</hi> And where this agreement in the Lord is not, there the Lord is not.</p>
                  <p>And yet in matters wherein wee differ one from an other, how hardly are we brought to bee of one accord in the Lord? If we differ in matters of religion, either we will not vouchſafe one to talke with an other in them, or if we doe, we will be ſure to ſet that downe with our ſelues, that howſoeuer wee be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced, yet we wil neuer yeeld to agree with them that would perſwade vs. We haue too too lamentable experience of it. For when we talk with them that are popiſhly affected, though they be conuinced, yet will they not yeelde to agree with vs. Likewiſe if we differ in matters of ciuill life, how hardly are we brought one to yeeld vnto another, and all to agree on that which is moſt euidently good? Nay if wee haue once taken a ſtitch againſt it, we will neuer agree to it whatſoeuer come of it. But beloued, this becommeth not the Goſpell of Chriſt. If we will walke worthy of Chriſt, let vs be like minded, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſame loue, being of one accord.</p>
                  <p>The 3. thing which I note is, that the Apoſtle would haue them to bee of one iudgement, i. to agree in one truth of Chriſt Ieſus. Whence I obſerue a threefold neceſſarie dutie

                  <p>The firſt thing which here I note, is, that the Apoſtle would haue nothing done among the <hi>Philippians</hi> through contention, he would haue none of them to take delight in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſſenting from other men in iudgement, or in any other thing, he would haue none of them to be contentious perſons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uch as cannot abide to agree with others, though they bee in the right, ſuch as are neuer well but when they are in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in contradiction. Whence I obſerue, that amongſt Chriſtians called to the knowledge of God by the Goſpell of Chriſt, all contention ſhould be abandoned, nothing ſhould be done amongſt them through contention, they ſhould take no pleaſure in diſſenting from other men, either in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in any other thing. This our Apoſtle plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, where he ſaith, firſt, that contentions are a worke of the fleſh; and then, that <hi>they that are Chriſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20.24.</note> 
                     <hi>haue crucified the fleſh, with the affections, and the luſts.</hi> Lay then theſe together thus: <hi>They that are Chriſts, haue crucified the fleſh, with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and the luſts,</hi> ſo that they doe not ſerue ſinne in the luſts thereof. But contentions are an affection and luſt of the fleſh, reckoned vp with adulterie, fornication, idolatrie, witchcraft, hereſies, murders, drunkenneſſe, gluttonie, and ſuch like. What then muſt needs follow, but that they that belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, muſt abandon all contentions, muſt doe nothing vpon a humour to thwart and to croſſe, vpon a delight to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and to differ. And the reaſon hereof is very plaine: for when men once grow to that, that they take a delight and pleaſure in croſſing and thwarting other men, and in oppoſing
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:599:167"/> themſelues vnto whatſoeuer they ſay, be the thing neuer ſo cleere, neuer ſo true, how can they as becommeth Chriſtian be of one accord with others? Nay how can it bee, but that ſuch oppoſition and contradiction ſhould breed great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and diſſenſion?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 26.21.</note> It is one of <hi>Salomons</hi> Prouerbs, <hi>As the cole maketh burning coles, and wood a fire, ſo the contentions man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> apt to kindle ſtrife.</hi> Whence it is cleere, that contention is as fit to ſtirre vp ſtrife, as cole and wood to make a fire. Looke into the Church: The ſchiſmes and hereſies, the broiles and ſtirres, wherewith the Church at all times is troubled, whence are they? Are they not commonly from men of contentious humours, which take a pleaſure in diſſenting from the reſt of the Church, and in maintaining new and quaint opinions by the ſharpneſſe of their wits? <hi>Arrius, Neſtorius, Macedoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> and many other the like, by whoſe hereſies the Church hath heretofore beene troubled, were they not ſuch men? And what are they that endanger the peace of the Church in our day? Are they not ſuch men? Againe, looke into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: The diuiſions and diſcords, the tumults and brabbles, wherewith all ſocieties and bodies are troubled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence are they? Are they not commonly from contentious men, which loue to ſay and doe otherwiſe than the reſt? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath ſo tried it, that it will not be denied. So that ye ſee there is great reaſon of abandoning al contentions among Chriſtians, that nothing be done through contention amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>What then? May nothing be done through contention? If 400. falſe Prophets counſell <hi>Ahab</hi> to goe to warre,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 18.</note> may not <hi>Michaiah</hi> ſet himſelfe againſt them all, and tell <hi>Ahab,</hi> that if he goe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.10.</note> he ſhall fall there? May not <hi>Ieremie</hi> contend and ſtriue euen with the whole earth, as himſelfe witneſſeth that he did? Indeed if <hi>Michaiah</hi> or <hi>Ieremie</hi> doe ſo, they ſhall bee counted contentious men for their paines, inſomuch that <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſhall crie out, and ſay, <hi>Woe is mee, my mother, that thou haſt borne me a contentious man, and a man that ſtriueth with the whole earth;</hi> for ſo he was accounted. And ſo our whole Church, for diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Romiſh Church, wee are counted ſchiſmaticall, hereticall, contentious men. But ye muſt know that there is

Indeede if we were hamble men, it muſt needs be that we ſhould be like minded, hauing the ſame loue, being of one accord, and of one iudgement, it could not be that any thing ſhould be done through contention, or vaine-glory amongſt vs.</p>
                  <p>An excellent vertue then, an excellent grace of God is this humilitie and meekneſſe of minde: but as rare as it is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. For who is he that in meeknes of minde eſteemeth other better then himſelfe? Very common it is with vs in the vanitie of our minde to eſteeme of our ſelues better then of others, to thinke of our ſelues as the proud Phariſie did in the Goſpell of himſelfe, and of others as he did of the Publican; to thinke our owne penny the beſt ſiluer, to value our owne gifts at the greateſt worth, to make our ſelues equall vnto the beſt, and in taking honor to preuent one another. But very rare it is to thinke of others better then of our ſelues, to make our ſelues equall to them of the lower ſort, in giuing honor one to goe before another, in rating of gifts to ſet our owne as the loweſt rate. Nay we can ſay that this is no world for hum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bleneſſe and meeknes of minde, we muſt now either thinke
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:599:170"/> well of our ſelues, or elſe none will thinke well of vs, we muſt now thruſt out our ſelues before others, or elſe we ſhall be left behind all others; we muſt now either exalt our ſelues in ſome conceit of our ſelues, or elſe we ſhall be ſo humbled, that we ſhall be nought ſet by. And it is ſo indeed. But the leſſe that this vertue is practiſed, the more it is to be vrged; and the leſſe fauour it findeth amongſt the ſonnes of men, the more it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth of ſuch grace as becomes the ſonnes of God. Yea but we can obiect againſt it, and ſay, what if we know that we are better then others, more learned then others, more wiſe then others &amp;c, are we then in meeknes of minde to eſteeme others better then our ſelues? Wherevnto I anſwer, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this to be ſpoken as it is to the Church, that if we know ſome things in our ſelues, whereby we are better then others of our brethren, yet withall we muſt know that this grace is not giuen vs to lift vp our ſelues aboue them; but for our ſelues in comparing our ſelues with others, we are to looke vpon our owne wants and imperfections, and thereby to be humbled in our ſelues; and for others, we are to couer their wants with charitie, and to looke vpon the good things in them, and ſo to preferre them before our ſelues. Or we may ſay, that in modeſtie we are to yeeld in many things of our owne right, ſo that tho <hi>Dauid</hi> knew himſelfe to be better then <hi>Saul,</hi> yet in modeſtie and in meekneſſe of minde hee may eſteeme <hi>Saul</hi> better then himſelfe. Whatſoeuer be obiected againſt this rare grace of humilitie, yet thus we muſt cut off contention and vaine-glory, or elſe vnitie and loue ſhall neuer be preſerued amongſt vs.</p>
                  <p>Here then we ſee why it is that we are not like minded one towards another, hauing the ſame loue, being of one accord, and of one iudgement: why it is that many things are done amongſt vs through contention and vaine-glory; and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not in vs that meeknes of minde to eſteeme others better then our ſelues. In the words therefore of the Apoſtle, <hi>I beſeech you as the elect of God, holy and beloued,</hi>

Whence briefly I obſerue two meanes whereby to come to humilitie, and to preſerue loue, concord, and vnanimitie: the one is not to looke on our owne things; the other, to looke on the things of other men. For if we looke euery man on his owne things, as for example, euery man on his owne graces, on his owne wit, on his owne lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, on his owne iudgment, or euery man on his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie &amp;c, and neglect or contemne the things of other men, what elſe will follow of this ſelfe-loue but vaine-glory? and what will follow of it but contention?

Thus ſhall wee be humbled in our owne eyes, and thus loue and concord ſhall be eaſily preſerued.</p>

                  <p>In theſe words which I haue now read vnto you, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle goeth forward to excite and ſtirre vp the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and in them vs, vnto this ſame true humilitie, meekneſſe of mind and brotherly loue. Wherein that hee might the rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with them, he preſſeth the example of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Let the ſame minde be in you, &amp;c.</hi> In the opening and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which example of Chriſt Ieſus, he firſt ſetteth down his humilitie, and then the iſſue thereof, which was his exaltation
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:599:172"/> into glorie. His humilitie is here deſcribed to bee twofold. Firſt, in that he being in the forme of God, i. being God, and without all iniurie to the Godhead, equall in might, power, and maieſtie vnto the Father, yet made himſelfe of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant, 1. was made man, euen the moſt abiect amongſt men. 2. In that being made man he humbled himſelfe, willingly laying aſide as it were the power of his Godhead, and became obedient, in all things which the law required of him, vnto the death, euen the moſt ſhamefull death of the Croſſe. After this double deſcription of Chriſt his humility, followeth, and is ſet down the iſſue thereof, which was that hee was not left in this lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> eſtate, but was highly exalted far aboue all principalitie, and power, and might, and domination, and euery name that is named not in this world only, but in that alſo that is to come, ſo that at his name ſhould bowe euery knee, both of things in heauen &amp;c. The argument then or reaſon, which the Apoſtle draweth, to perſwad them to true humility, &amp; brotherly loue one towards another, from Chriſt his example in effect is this: If Chriſt who being God bleſſed for euer, and equall to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet ſo farre humbled himſelfe that he became man, and tooke on him the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh: And againe, if Chriſt deſcending from heauen in the ſimilitude of ſinnefull fleſh, and being made man, did yet ſo farre humble himſelfe, that he became obedient to the death, euen the death of the croſſe. Laſtly, if Chriſt being God, and hauing humbled himſelfe to be man, and being man, hauing humbled himſelfe to the death of the croſſe, was therefore highly exalted, and had a name giuen him aboue euery name &amp;c. how then ought we ſinfull men to put on vs this humility, and meeknes of minde, no man through arrogancie treading downe his weake brethren, but euery man eſteeming other better then himſelfe? This I take to be the Apoſtles argument in this place. It is then as if he had thus ſaid:</p>
                  <p>O ye <hi>Philippians</hi> my hearts deſire for you is, that ye may be found perfit and entire, lacking nothing, in the day of Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore I beſeech you that nothing be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you through contention, or through vaine glorie, but
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:599:172"/> that ye be like minded one towards another, that ye loue one an other, and that in all humbleneſſe and meekneſſe of minde ye ſubmit your ſelues one vnto an other, &amp; euery man eſteem other better then himſelfe. Learne I beſeech you of Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, whoſe Diſciples, whoſe ſeruants, members of whoſe bodie ye are, learne I ſay of him to bee humble and meeke. For he being God, and without all iniurie to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head equall in glorie, and honour, and maieſtie vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet made himſelfe of no reputation, and became man, and was like vnto man in deſires, in infirmities, in ſorrowes, and in all things ſinne only excepted: yea being man, he ſo far humbled himſelfe, that he was obedient in all things euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, and that the ſhamefull death of the croſſe, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he hung betweene two theeues. Let the ſame minde bee in you that was in Chriſt Ieſus: be ye humble and meeke as hee was, not in that degree, but in ſome meaſure frame your ſelues vnto that humilitie that was in him, and then aſſure your ſelues, that as Chriſt was not thus lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> but was highly exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c. ſo you, if you humble your ſelues, you ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This I take to be the meaning of theſe wordes of the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>They braunch themſelues, as you may ſee, into three parts: whereof the firſt is, an exhortation vnto humility, and meekneſſe of minde, <hi>Let the ſame minde &amp;c.</hi> 2.

                  <p>Firſt therefore in the exhortation wee are to note what it is whereunto the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and in them vs. The thing whereunto he exhorteth both them, and vs, and all that will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus, is, that wee ſhould bee humble and lowly, kind and curteous, gentle and louing one vnto an other, in all humbleneſſe ſubmitting our ſelues euery man one vnto another, and in all meekneſſe of minde eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:599:173"/> euery other man better then himſelfe. The like exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſame Apoſtle maketh,<note place="margin">

For if wee loue our brethren, then we can willingly ſubmit our ſelues vnto them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them before our ſelues: but where this loue of our bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren is not, there is contempt of them, and lifting vp of our ſelues aboue them. The like exhortation alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Submit your ſelues euery man one vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to an other, and decke your ſelues inwardly in lowlineſſe of minde:</hi> In which place you ſee how the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of humility, as of a ſpeciall ornament wherewithall the childe of God is decked, and beautified more than with all coſtly iewels, and precious ointments whatſoeuer. But here it is to be obſerued, euen from the Apoſtle in this place of <hi>Peter,</hi> that there is a two fold humilitie and holineſſe; the one inward, the other outward; the one of the minde, the other to the eye, the one true and holy, the other ill and hypocriticall. Of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and hypocriticall humbleneſſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh where he thus writeth vnto the <hi>Coloſſians; Let no man at his pleaſure beare rule ouer you by humbleneſſe of minde,</hi>

Much like vnto thoſe who at this day teach men to vſe the interceſſion of the ſaints departed this mortaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to make their praiers vnto them, not boldly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſlie themſelues to enter into the Kings palace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of grace, but in all humblenes to proſtrate themſelues before the ſaints and their images, that ſo their praiers and ſupplications through their interceſſion may bee

It is the heart, the minde, and the ſoule that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth: there muſt be the ſeate of humilitie, if it be true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. The glorie of the true Chriſtian is within; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſa.</hi> 45.13.</note> the kings daughter, i. the Church, and then if thou be a liuely member of the Church, thy glory is within, and thy outward humility is then good when it proceedeth from within, euen from the lowlineſſe of the minde.</p>
                  <p>And now that you ſee what it is, euen what humility it is that the Apoſtle exhorteth vnto, <hi>I beſeech you</hi> (with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>that the ſame minde be in you that was euen in Chriſt Ieſus, that in meekeneſſe of minde euery man eſteem other better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> It is an exhortation, which if we ſhall a little looke into ſome of thoſe properties which alwaies follow this humblenes of minde wherunto the Apoſtle exhorteth, I feare me we ſhall finde that we haue either neuer heard of, or neuer hearkened vnto. The propertie of it is, <hi>in giuing honour to preferre others,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10</note> as ye haue already heard out of the Apoſtle: and as is further prooued by that parable of our Sauiour Chriſt vnto the gueſt when he marked how <hi>they choſe out the chiefe roomes at feaſts.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.7.</note> Out of both which places it may appeare that he that is truely humbled, in matters of honour preferreth not himſelfe before others, but preferreth others before himſelfe. But how farre we are from this humilitie, the great ambition of men in our daies, and great ſeeking of euery preferment, yea of euery petite office in euery towne incorporate, would ſpeake if I ſhould hold my peace. Nay ſo farre are we from preferring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before our ſelues, that rather than we will not clime ouer the heads of thoſe that are better than our ſelues we will vſe all bribery and corruption, yea &amp; out of our falſe hearts we will deuiſe all manner of lies and ſlanders againſt them, and rather then faile we will libell againſt them. It is ſo, and where it is
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:599:174"/> ſo there wants this humbleneſſe of minde here ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Another property of it is, that hee that is humble, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> our Sauiour calleth him <hi>poore in ſpirit</hi> eſteemeth others better than himſelfe, as the Apoſtle ſheweth verſ. 3. He ſtandeth not vpon the conceit of his knowledge, of his honour, of his wealth, of his friends. If he haue theſe things hee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth them to be the bleſſings of the Lord, but no cauſe why he ſhould ſwell with pride, or aduance himſelfe aboue his brethren. But doth not the wealthy rich man treade vnder foote, and oppreſſe with all wrong and violence his poore neighbours? Is not the great Scholar, and wiſe man ſo puft vp with his knowledge that he counts of others little better than fooles? Doth not the great man, whether it be that he bee great in office, or in birth and friends, doth hee not diſdaine his inferiours, and oftentimes make a mocke of them? I wiſh it were not ſo: but if it be ſo, there wants in them this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of minde here ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>A third propertie of it is, as to humble vs ſo before God that we willingly acknowledge whatſoeuer good thing wee haue, to be onely from God without any merit in our ſelues ſo without ſelfe reſpects to regard the good of others, and of Gods Church. For the truely humbled man doth not looke on his owne things, as it is in the former verſe, as ſo louing them that he careth not for the things of other men; but he looketh on the things of other men, and whatſoeuer is good for Gods Church that he doth. I wiſh there were no cauſe of feare that this humbleneſſe of minde were wanting. But who ſeeth not that the reformation of many abuſes is hindred, that many godly and Chriſtian exerciſes are ſtaied, that much good many times is left vndone? and why? Forſooth becauſe ſuch a one moued it, becauſe ſuch and ſuch men call for it, ſuch and ſuch men like too well of if, and therfore rather then pleaſe their humours, let things ſtand as they are. A thing in practiſe too too common, and what humbleneſſe of minde where it is ſo? By this which hath already beene ſpoken, I thinke, it may appeare how little hitherto we haue hearkened to this exhortation of the Apoſtle. Well I beſeech you, that whatſoeuer is amiſſe in this behalfe may be amended. <hi>Decke

                  <p>Thirdly, I note the humilitie of Chriſt, whoſe example the Apoſtle here exhorteth vs to follow. His humilitie is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Apoſtle, firſt by his incarnation, in that being God, he vouchſafed to take fleſh of the bleſſed Virgin, and to become man, like vnto vs in all things, ſinne only excepted ſecondly, by the worke of our redemption, in that being man he yet againe further <hi>humbled himſelfe, and became obedient to the death, euen the moſt ſhamefull death of the Croſſe.</hi> In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Chriſt his incarnation are very many things moſt worthy our obſeruation, touching both the natures in Chriſt his God head, and his Manhood. I can only point at ſome of the heads of thoſe obſeruations which hence were to bee made, and more fully handled. Firſt for the Godhead of Chriſt, in that it is here ſaid, that hee <hi>was in the forme of God,</hi> it is thereby proued, that Chriſt was true God: for in the ſelfe ſame manner and phraſe of ſpeech that here he is ſaid to be in the forme of God, in the ſame is it afterward ſaid that hee <hi>tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant.</hi> Where by the forme of a ſeruant the Apoſtle expreſſeth his Manhead, as here by the forme of God is expreſſed his Godhead. Neither indeed can any be in the forme of God, who is not true God. And as in this place he is ſaid to be in the forme of God, whereby is meant that he is God; ſo in other places plainly and directly heads ſaid to be God,<note place="margin">

A diſtinction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of natures there is in Chriſt, but no confuſion of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; one Chriſt, and he both God and man.

                     </gap> haue I briefly pointed at ſome of thoſe notes and obſeruation which may eaſily bee gathered touching the Godhead and Manhood of Chriſt, out of this deſcription of Chriſt his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie in his incarnation.</p>
                  <p>To knit vp the whole in one generall note and obſeruation, here wee may moſt cleerely obſerue the great humilitie of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus: euen this one deſcription of his incarnation may both moſt liuely preſent it before our eyes, and be a moſt cleere patterne vnto vs how wee ought to be minded one towards another. Hee that was very God, of the ſubſtance of the Father, glorious in maieſtie, wonderfull in power, only wiſe, of right, and without any iniurie to the Godhead at all, euery way equall vnto God the Father, of himſelfe vouchſafed to deſcend from his high and glorious maieſtie, and to take into the vnitie of his perſon the nature of a man, euen the baſe condition of a ſeruant, and in euery thing that concernes mans nature to bee like vnto all other
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:599:176"/> men, ſinne only excepted. Here is loue paſſing the loue of women, and here is humilitie beyond all compariſon. Who knoweth not this? and yet who followeth this patterne of Chriſt Ieſus ſet before him? He when we were enemies vnto him, vouchſafed to come vnto vs: which of vs will vouchſafe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he commandement be, that the Sunne ſhould not go downe vpon our wrath? Nay how hardly are wee drawne to come vnto him that hath thus vouchſafed to come vnto vs? Let the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hee for vs vouchſafed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from his high Throne of Maieſtie, and to become man: But which of vs will ſtoope downe a whit, or at all let downe our ſaile for our poore brethrens ſake? Nay if wee bee aboue them, rather than wee will looke ſo low, wee will turne them out of houſe and home, out of lands and goods, yea wee will ſuffer them for want of food to periſh in our ſtreets. O if Chriſt Ieſus had beene ſo vnkinde vnto thee, how hadſt thou ere this beene plunged into the bottomeleſſe pit of hell, and ſo beene preuented of this vnkindneſſe to thy brother? He diſdained not to take on him euen the baſeſt condition of a man, euen of a ſeruant, and for our ſakes to become poore, that wee through his pouertie might be made rich. But how many of vs with patience doc beare our pouertie? Nay doe wee not murmur and grudge againſt God, as an vnequall diſpoſer of theſe temporall bleſſings? Doe wee not often breake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe intemperate ſpeeches, Rather than we will thus want, wee will rob by the high wayes ſide, or ſteale; Rather than we will ſtarue, wee will haue it out of the rich mans belly? &amp;c. But know thou, that vnleſſe Chriſt had beene poore for thy ſake, thou hadſt had thy portion with the Deuill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. He tooke vpon him our infirmities, that ſo hee might take compaſſion on our infirmities. But how many of vs are moued to take compaſſion on the miſeries, diſtreſſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of our brethren? Nay how many of vs doe ſhut vp all bowels of compaſſion againſt thoſe that are in miſerie and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:599:177"/> diſtreſſe? not clothing the naked, not feeding the hungry, not viſiting the ſicke, not releeuing the diſtreſſed. O my brethres, <hi>let the ſame minde be in you that was in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> If hee thus humbled himſelfe for our ſakes, let vs follow him in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of humilitie.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E humbled himſelfe, &amp;c.]</hi> In which words the Apoſtle firſt propoſeth this ſecond humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in generall, ſaying, <hi>Hee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe.</hi> Secondly, the Apoſtle deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it more particularly by the obedience of Chriſt vnto the death, ſaying, <hi>and became obedient vnto the death.</hi> Where the Apoſtle noteth a two-fold obedience of Chriſt, the one before his death in his whole life, the other in and at his death; the former conſiſting in Chriſt his fulfilling of the Law, the latter in his whole ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of death, and all the paines and ſorrowes thereof: for in that it is ſaid, that Chriſt became obedient vnto the death, the Apoſtle his meaning is, that Chriſt was obedient in all things that the Law required of him, both doing the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the whole courſe of his life, and further ſubiecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto the death; ſo that hee was not only obedient to his Father to fulfill the Law for vs, but he was obedient vnto the death, to lay downe his life for our ſakes. Laſtly, this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his death is amplified by the kinde thereof, <hi>hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Croſſe,</hi> which
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:599:178"/> was the moſt ſhamefull and moſt accurſed kinde of death. So that the meaning of the Apoſtle in this place is, that Chriſt who ſo had already humbled himſelfe, that of the Sonne of God he was now become the ſonne of man, did yet further humble and abaſe himſelfe, and became obedient vnto his Fathers will in all things that the Law required of him, euen vnto the ſuffering of death for vs miſerable ſinners, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe vnto death for vs, and that the moſt ſhamefull death of the Croſſe. This I take to be the meaning.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words then wee are to note foure doctrines tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Chriſt. The firſt is touching his humiliation: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond touching his obedience in his life: The third is touching his death: The fourth is touching his kinde of death.</p>
                  <p>In his humiliation I note firſt the perſon that was humbled, ſecondly the manner of his humiliation, both ſet downe by the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>he humbled himſelfe.</hi> For the firſt, touching the perſon, hence it appeareth that hee who being God, and equall with the Father, was now become man, <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe, and became &amp;c.</hi> The perſon then that was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled was Chriſt, God and man, perfect God and perfect man, ſubſiſting of a reaſonable ſoule and humane fleſh. And neceſſary it was that he who was now to worke the worke of our redemption, ſhould be both God and man: man, that as man had ſinned, ſo ſinne might bee puniſhed in man, for ſo Gods iuſtice required: God, that he might be able to ſuſtaine the grieuouſneſſe of the puniſhment due to our ſinnes, which ſhould be temporall, but yet equiualent to eternall paines; for our ſinnes being infinite, and the puniſhment due vnto them being infinite, becauſe thereby wee had grieued an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, the perſon muſt needs be infinite which ſhould pay the price of our ſinnes. Againe, it was neceſſary that he ſhould be man, that he might ſuffer death, becauſe for ſinne man had deſerued death; and neceſſary likewiſe that he ſhould be God, that he might be able to wreſtle with the wrath of God, which none elſe could doe but he that was God. Needs therefore muſt he be both God and man. And that he was ſo, as by this place it is plaine,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</note> ſo by that likewiſe in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the Apoſtle exhorteth the Elders of <hi>Epheſus to feed the Church of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:599:178"/> God, which he</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath purchaſed with his owne bloud.</hi> In which place, he who hath purchaſed a Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, is both called God, and alſo witneſſed to be true man, in that he purchaſed it with his owne bloud.</p>
                  <p>Here then we may ſee the hainouſneſſe and grieuouſneſſe of our ſinnes, and the greatneſſe of our miſerie by reaſon of them. God bleſſed for euer muſt become man, and God and man muſt be vnited into one Chriſt, and being thus vnited, muſt be humbled vnto the death, and muſt pay the price of our ſinnes by ſhedding of his owne bloud, or elſe the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting curſe of Gods wrath abideth vpon vs, and our portion is with the Deuill and his Angels in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for euer. And yet what account or recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at all is made of ſinne? Surely ſo little, that it may bee very well ſaid vnto vs which <hi>Hoſea</hi> the Prophet ſometime ſaid vnto the children of <hi>Iſrael, Heare the word of the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1.1.</note> 
                     <hi>ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, for the Lord hath a controuerſie with the inhabitants of the land, becauſe there is no truth, &amp;c.</hi> And yet what remorſe of theſe things euen now when the whole land mourneth for them, and groaneth vnder the burden of them? It had not beene poſſible to ſatisfie Gods iuſtice for the leaſt of our ſinnes otherwiſe than by euerlaſting death, vnleſſe God had become man, and ſo humbled himſelfe to ſuffer whatſoeuer was due for mans ſinne: and yet who is he that conſidereth in heart his ſinnes, to reforme the wickedneſſe of his way? <hi>O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, yee that forget God,</hi> and grieue his holy ſpirit by your continuall committed ſinnes, <hi>leſt he plucke you away, and there be none to deliuer you.</hi> Flie from ſinne as from a Serpent. Chriſt Ieſus both God and man hath paid the price for our ſinnes. Let vs not therefore henceforth ſerue ſinne in the luſts thereof, but let vs glorifie God both in our bodies and in our ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I noted in Chriſt his humiliation was the manner of Chriſt his humiliation: which I note 1. was voluntarie. 2. that both his manhood and his Godhead was abaſed. That his humiliation was voluntarie appeareth by that it is ſaid, that <hi>he humbled himſelfe.</hi> As then his firſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, when being God he tooke on him mans nature, was
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:599:179"/> voluntarie; ſo his ſecond humiliation, when being both God and man he ſubiected himſelfe vnto the law, and vnto death, was voluntarie. How then is it ſaid, that <hi>he was made obedient</hi> for ſo it is read in the originall. He was made obedient, not of any other but of himſelfe, neither forcedly, but willingly he made himſelfe obedient, euen as willingly hee humbled himſelfe. Now for the other point that Chriſt was abaſed and humbled both according to his Godhead and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. 1. For his manhood it doth appeare, in that it was made ſubiect to the infirmities of mans nature, as alſo to the miſeries and puniſhments which were due vnto man for ſinne 2. for his Godhead, it was alſo abaſed, not as it is conſidered in it ſelfe, for ſo it is immutable; but in reſpect of the vaile of the fleſh, vnder which it was ſo couered, that it lay hid from the firſt moment of Chriſt his incarnation, to the time of his reſurrection, without any great manifeſtation of his power and maieſtie therein.</p>
                  <p>Did he then who was both God and man thus voluntarily humble himſelfe in his Godhead, and in his manhood? did he ſo abaſe himſelfe that he would be borne in a cratch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with poore fiſhermen, eat and drinke with Publicans and ſinners, be baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> be tempted of the Deuil, waſh his Diſciples feete, and as a Lambe before the ſhearer ſo not open his mouth? What ſhould this teach vs my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Euen willingly to ſubmit our ſelues one vnto another; and all of vs to decke our ſelues inwardly with lowlineſſe or minde. If abundance of wiſdome and knowledge, if greatnes in honor and dignitie, if ſoueraigne power and authoritie had beene ſufficient motiues and inducements for our Sauiour Chriſt to ſtay himſelfe from thus humbling himſelfe, <hi>his name was wonderful, counſeller, the mighty God, the euerlaſting father, the prince of peace,</hi> to him did belong <hi>all honor and glory, in him were hid all the treaſures of wiſdome &amp; knowledge,</hi> &amp; <hi>of his fulneſſe haue all we receiued, &amp; grace for grace:</hi> yet for all this he thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe willingly, as yee haue heard. Let not therefore the conceit of wiſdome and knowledge in our ſelues; let not the conceit of our wealth and riches, of our preferments and honors, of our birth and friends cauſe vs to ſwell with pride
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:599:179"/> of our owne gifts, or to lift vp our ſelues aboue our brethren, to diſdaine our inferiors; let not theſe be any ſtaies why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Here then is the third
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:599:181"/> doctrine touching Chriſt which I propoſed to be obſerued, which is touching his death: vnder which name I vnderſtand not onely the ſeparation of his ſoule from his bodie, but all the paines and agonies which he ſuffered both in ſoule and bodie. For as it was written of him, <hi>He bare our infirmities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and caried our ſinnes, he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was broken for our iniquities,</hi> he made his ſoule an offering for ſin, <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was vpon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed;</hi> as thus, I ſay, it was written of him, ſo thus he ſuffered, and was obedient vnto the death. Will you then ſee what manner of death Chriſt ſuffered? He ſuffered not onely a bodily death, and ſuch paines as follow the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, but he ſuffered likewiſe in his ſoule the wrath of God for the ſinnes of the world lying ſo heauy vpon him that it wounded his fleſh and his ſpirit alſo as the ſcripture ſpeaketh <hi>euen to death.</hi> For if he had ſuffered no more but in bodie, then he ouercame no more but a bodily death, and then were our ſtate moſt miſerable: but our ſinnes hauing deſerued not the bodily death onely, but euen death both of body and ſoule, by the death which he ſuffered he ouercame death and the power of it both in our bodies and in our ſoules. Whence was it that when his death approched he began to be in ſorrow and heauineſſe? Whence was it that he ſaid vnto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>my ſoule is very heauy euen vnto the death?</hi> Whence was it that ſo often he fell on his face, and praied, that <hi>if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that cup might paſſe from him?</hi> Whence was it that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell appeared from heauen vnto him to comfort &amp; ſtrengthen him? Whence was it that as he praied, <hi>his ſweat was like drops of bloud, trickling downe to the ground?</hi> Was not this and all this euen from the paines which he felt in his ſoule by reaſon of the wrath of God againſt ſinne? Can we thinke that all this came to our Sauiour Chriſt for feare of a bodily death? Haue his ſeruants that receiue of his fulneſſe ſo deſpiſed this death of the body, that either they wiſht for it to be with Chriſt, or reioyced in the middeſt of it before the perſecutor, and did our Sauiour himſelfe ſo feare and tremble at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it? Did the Apoſtles ſing in priſon, and reioyce when they were whipt and ſcourged? Did <hi>Paul</hi> glory in the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:599:182"/> tribulations which he ſuffered, and did our Sauiour in ſuch like paine crie in the bitternes of his ſoule, <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Nay my brethren, that which made Chriſt to be heauie would haue cruſht his Apoſtles in pieces: that which made him ſweat bloud in the garden would haue ſunke them into hell: that which made him crie would haue held both men &amp; Angels vnder euerlaſting woe and lamentation. Beſides his bodily death therefore, and the paines that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereupon, hee felt in his ſoule moſt grieuous paines through the wrath of God which was vpon him for our ſins. And thus ye ſee what death he ſuffered for our ſakes, when he was made obedient to the death.</p>
                  <p>The fruites and benefits which wee receiue by Chriſt his death are theſe. 1. By his death we are freed from that death which is both of body and ſoule, haue the victory ouer that death which is the reward of ſinne, as witneſſeth the Apoſtle. For our Sauiour by <hi>his death hath pulled out the ſting of death,</hi>

In which holy ſupper the death and paſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, is ſo liuely repreſented vnto vs a, if we had ſeene it with our eies. the bread betokening the body, the wine the bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt; the breaking likewiſe of the bread ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the breaking of his body with thoſe vnſpeakable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he ſuffered, and the pouring out of the wine the ſhedding of his moſt precious bloud, when his bleſſed ſide was gored with the ſpeare of a ſouldier; our eating of the bread and drinking of the wine, aſſuring vs of our incorporation into Chriſt, to be made partakers of all the benefits of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:599:182"/> When ye come therefore to this holy Supper, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ye are called hither to continue the remembrance of his bleſſed death and paſſion, vntill his bleſſed comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Repent you earneſtly of your manifold ſinnes for the remiſſion whereof Chriſt ſhed his owne hearts bloud. Loue one an other, euen as he hath loued vs who laid downe his life for vs. And haue faith in Chriſt Ieſus, whom God hath ſet foorth to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloud. By faith in Chriſt Ieſus we receiue remiſſion of our ſinnes, and all other benefits of his death and paſſion. By loue of our brethren we teſtifie our loue of God, who ſent his ſonne to be a reconciliation for our ſinnes. And with the contrition and ſorrow of our hearts for our ſinnes, the Lord is better pleaſed then with all burnt offerings and ſacrifices. Theſe are the things which the Lord requireth of vs, euen faith, repentance, and loue, and as at all times, ſo at this time eſpecially when we come to the receiuing of theſe holy myſteries let vs thinke of theſe things. He that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, crucifying againe vnto himſelfe the Lord of glory, and King of our peace. But hee that examineth himſelfe, and ſo eateth of this bread, and drinketh of this cuppe, is made one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with him, and Chriſt ſhall raiſe him vp at the laſt day, ſo that he ſhall neuer ſee death, becauſe he belieueth in him who died for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our iuſtification. It followeth.</p>

Here then is the fourth and laſt point which I noted in theſe words, which is, the kinde of his death, whereunto he ſubmitted himſelfe. The kinde of his death was, he was crucified betweene two Theeues, where he was mocked of all ſorts of men, where in feeling of the whole wrath of God vpon him, he cried out, <hi>my God, my God why haſt thou f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Whence 1. we may learne with bitterneſſe to bewaile our ſinnes, for which Chriſt was thus cruelly nailed on the croſſe,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:599:183"/> and there ſuffered the whole wrath of God. 2. To crucifie our fleſh, and the corruption of our nature, and the wickedneſſe of our hearts.<note place="margin">

It may teach vs that when wee ſuffer any iudgement, croſſe, or calamity in body, or in minde, wee doe not ſuffer them as any curſes of God, but as the chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a louing father. For Chriſt Ieſus in his croſſe being accurſed for vs, hath deliuered vs from all curſe. Beloued, let vs thinke of theſe things, mourning for our ſinnes, mortifying the deedes of the fleſh, and comforting our ſelues in the croſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, who abaſed himſelfe for vs, fulfilled the whole law for vs, died for our ſinnes, and was nailed to the croſſe for our iniquities.</p>
                  <p>O Lord teach vs to humble our ſelues both before thee, and one vnto another; teach vs to doe thy will, teach vs to die vnto ſinne that we may liue vnto thee, and daily more and more crucifie the old man in vs, that being renued in the ſpirit of our mindes we may henceforth ſerue thee in holines and righteouſnes all the daies of our life.</p>

But it ſhall be to no purpoſe: for all ſhall ſtand before him, and fall downe before him.

That euen the wicked and vngodly of the earth, and all the powers of darknes are now ſo ſubiect vnto him, that though they would, yet they can doe nothing but what his will is. 3. That in the laſt and great day, all creatures, euen all abſolutely ſhall be ſubiect vnto him, holy men and Angels willingly ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting themſelues vnto him, and worſhipping him; and all the reſt, though vnwillingly, ſubiecting themſelues vnto him, and to their finall iudgement, as iuſt in it ſelfe vnto them, and from a moſt iuſt God.</p>
                  <p>By the firſt anſwer we are inſtructed in a neceſſarie dutie, which is, that we ought to be ſubiect vnto Chriſt in obedience vnto his heauenly will; and to worſhip him with all holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, walking in his waies, and keeping his commandements.

                  <p>Now beſides the ſubſtance of the exhortation, there are many circumſtances whereby the exhortation is amplified and enlarged, and which are together with the exhortation to be opened and declared. To compriſe then the whole, in theſe words of the Apoſtle I conſider theſe points: firſt the ground whereon the Apoſtle doth build his exhortation which is the humilitie and obedience of Chriſt, noted in the word <hi>wherefore;</hi> for it is as much as if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid, Seeing ſuch was Chriſt his humilitie, and ſuch his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as yee haue heard, therefore my beloued follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and <hi>as yee haue alwayes obeyed, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle his kinde intreatie of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> ſo to winne them to harken to his exhortation in that he calleth them his beloued <hi>wherefore my beloued.</hi> 3.

We muſt not here ſtand at a ſtay, much leſſe muſt wee go backward; we muſt go forward, and wee muſt pricke hard vnto the marke of the high calling that is ſet before vs. For in the way of godlineſſe that is moſt true which is ſo common, not to goe forward in that way is in truth to goe backward. But I ſhall haue occaſion againe to ſpeake of this point in handling the exhortation.</p>
                  <p>To leaue therefore this point, here it may be demanded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>how the Apoſtle ſaith that the <hi>Philippians</hi> had alwaies obeyed, <hi>as yee haue alwaies obeyed.</hi> For in that the Apoſtle doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them, euery man to eſteeme other better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as <hi>verſe</hi> 3. and to doe all things wihout murmuring and reaſoning, as <hi>verſe</hi> 14. he plainely ſignifieth that there were many faults amongſt them, euen contention, vaine-glory, murmuring, reaſoning, and the like. How then doth he giue them this teſtimonie, that they had alwaies obeyed? Lied the Apoſtle vnto them, or did he flatter them? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid: <hi>let God be true, and euery man a lyer.</hi> He lieth not vnto them, neither doth he flatter them, and yet their obedience vnto God, and vnto his word, was not perfect; for no doubt ſuch faults were amongſt them, as already we haue ſpoken of. In this ſenſe then we are to vnderſtand the Apoſtle, when he commendeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> as hauing alwaies obeyed God and his word; not as if there had nothing lacked in their obedience: for <hi>in many things we ſinne all;</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and the truth is not in vs:</hi> but therefore are they ſaid alwaies to haue obeyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe howſoeuer their obedience in it ſelfe was vnperfect, yet
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:599:206"/> was it vnto them reputed as perfect, becauſe through faith they were ingrafted in Chriſt, and for his ſake their very deſire to liue godly was accepted with God as a life moſt holy. For ſuch is the fruit of our communion with Chriſt, that being ingrafted into his bodie, and made bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, through him, and for him, our faith in him is accounted to vs for righteouſneſſe, and our very deſire to liue goldy in this preſent world, is accounted vnto vs for holineſſe of life. If there were no other proofe for this point, but euen this whereof I ſpeake, that the Apoſtle here maketh reckoning of the <hi>Philippians</hi> as hauing alwaies obeyed, though there lacked much in their obedience, becauſe they beleeued in Chriſt, and deſired to liue godly, it were enough: but the ſcriptures euery where witneſſe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Here then we haue an exceeding great comfort in Chriſt Ieſus, that howſoeuer our obedience be vnperfit, yet if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue perfitly in Chriſt Ieſus, and ſtudie to liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, it is accounted as if we had alwaies obeyed. Our iniquities are forgiuen, one ſinnes are couered, our infirmities are paſſed ouer, our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes is not imputed vnto vs; only that which we haue well done is had in remembrance, and if we haue giuen but a cup of cold water in his name, it looſeth not the reward. This is that which doth and may vphold our weary and fainting ſoules, which otherwiſe would fall vnder their burthens; and this is that which may &amp; ought to perſwade vs to <hi>follow peace with all men,</hi>

                     <hi>Not as in my preſence onely, but now much more in mine abſence]</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle lightly toucheth a defect in their obedience, that it was not altogether ſuch now in his abſence from them, as it was when he was preſent with them; but he doth not touch it as with purpoſe much to note them for it, but his drift rather is in theſe words to inſtruct them in the qualitie of their obedience, that it ought not to be fained, as ſeruice onely to the eye, but it ought to be ſincere, and from a pure heart, as vnto the Lord who ſeeth all, and is preſent eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where.</p>
                  <p>Here one or two things may be noted but only by the way,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:599:206"/> becauſe the Apoſtle doth onely lightly touch them, and as it were by the way aduiſe vs of them. 1. In that the Apoſtle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mplieth a change in them now in his abſence from them, which was nto in his preſence with them, thence we may note <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow requiſite the preſence of the Paſtor with his people is. True it is, that the Apoſtle was not their Paſtor, but ſent to reach vnto the Gentiles in all places, and <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>rom them. But if in <hi>Paules</hi> abſence from them, when yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heir Miniſter was preſent with them, they began in a ſhort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pace ſomewhat to decline, how can we thinke but that they muſt needes decline where their Paſtor is neuer with them? Where prophecying faileth the people periſh; and when the Paſtor is not preſent, the Wolfe commeth, and the flocke is ſcattered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that the Apoſtle onely lightly toucheth a defect in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heir obedience, but not with purpoſe much to note it in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem, we may note what care is to be taken, that we doe not ſharply cenſure euery defect or fault which is in the godly. Some things in them muſt be lightly paſſed ouer, and they muſt be drawne on with all kindneſſe and meeknes to runne on in the race that is ſet before them. The godly is admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by a word, but the wicked goeth on in his folly, and careth not what is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But chiefly hence we are to note the qualitie of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto our God, that it ought not to be fained, as ſeruice to the eye, but ſincere, and from a pure heart, as vnto him that ſeeth all, and is preſent euery where. Which of vs is there that will commend that ſeruant, which is onely an eye-ſeruant, which will worke well in his maſters ſight, but not at all when he is abſent? Nay we will all condemne ſuch a ſeruant. But let vs take heede that therein we do not giue iudgment againſt our ſelues. If onely we make an outward ſhew of holineſſe, and ſerue not the Lord with our whole hearts, making his law our delight, and a ſingle obedience therevnto our chiefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, what are we but eye-ſeruants, and our portion what ſhall it bee but the portion of hypocrites? Beloued, our God whom we ſerue is not as man: he ſeeth all things, he is preſent
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:599:207"/> euery where, he ſearcheth the hearts and the reynes, and he vnderſtandeth all our thought long before they be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. It is no halting with him. Whatſoeuer we doe in the darknes, it is vnto him as if it were done in the light: for the darknes and light to him are both alike. <hi>Gehazi</hi> may offend when <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſees not, and may hope to conceale it from him, becauſe he ſees it not. But if <hi>Eliſha</hi> can deſcry his fault, how much more can our God deſcry all our waies, how hidden ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be? Let vs therefore walke before him with a ſingle heart; let vs ſerue him in ſpirit and in truth; let our obedience vnto him, and vnto his law ſpring from a pure heart, from a good conſcience, and from an vnfeigned faith. Such obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he requireth of vs; and ſuch obedience is the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we muſt walke to our heauenly <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:599:217"/> childe ſtandeth in awe of his father, and feareth to diſpleaſe him. For as the good and dutifull childe feareth his father albeit he doubteth not of his fathers loue towards him, nay as he doth the more feare to diſpleaſe his father, the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely that he is perſwaded of his fathers loue towards him: ſo the childe of God in whom this godly feare doth dwell, the more certainely he is perſwaded of the loue of God towards him in Chriſt Ieſus, the more he feareth him with this feare, the more he feareth to diſpleaſe him; and therefore doth the more eſchew that which is euill, and follow after that which is good and acceptable in his ſight. And this is ſo farre vnlike vnto that ſeruile and ſlauiſh feare, that this feare is neuer ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from loue, but the more we loue the more we feare to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him whom we loue, and the more we feare to diſpleaſe him whom we loue, the more we loue him. Now it is not to be doubted but that the Apoſtle in this place ſpeaketh of this godly feare, the other being ſuch a feare as the Holy Ghoſt throughout the whole ſcriptures would haue vtterly abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all the children of God. Yea but it is added <hi>with feare and trembling,</hi> which ſheweth that the Apoſtle doth not ſpeake of ſuch a feare as hath with it ioyned aſſurance of loue, but of ſuch a feare as is full of doubt; for trembling muſt needs argue doubtfulnes. See then I beſeech you that place of the Prophet where they are both ioyned as here in the Apoſtle, <hi>Serue the Lord with feare,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11.</note> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>and reioyce in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> Where by trembling cannot be meant any doubt or diſtruſt: (for what reioycing can be in ſuch trembling as ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of doubt or diſtruſt?) but by trembling is meant a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his maieſtie, in whoſe loue we are ſo to reioyce, as that withall we feare to diſpleaſe him. And as there the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſo here our Apoſtle would haue vs to ſerue the Lord with feare, to exclude all carnall ſecuritie, whereby we grow careleſſe and negligent to doe that which is good; and with trembling, to exclude arrogant preſumption, whereby we grow phariſaically proud of that good which we doe. The Apoſtle then when, he exhorteth vs to make an end of our owne ſaluation with feare and trembling, his meaning is this, that we ſhould finiſh our courſe in doing ſuch good workes
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:599:217"/> as God hath ordeined vs to walke in. But how? with feare and trembling, .i. with all humblenes and reuerence towards God, not doubting of his loue towards vs, but becauſe we know he loueth vs, fearing to diſpleaſe him, either by carnall ſecuritie of doing any good at all, or by vaine preſumption of our owne worthineſſe for that good which we doe.</p>
                  <p>The leſſon then which hence we are taught is, what ought to be the continuall conuerſation of a Chriſtian, and how we ought to walke in the whole courſe of our life. We ought to <hi>paſſe the time,</hi> euen the whole time <hi>of our dwelling here,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>in feare,</hi> euen in the reuerent feare of his moſt holy name, in whoſe fauour is life, and ioy for euermore. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know he loueth vs in his well beloued Sonne, we ought to be moſt loth any way to diſpleaſe him, and as duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children we ought to auoide and eſchew euery thing that may offend his godly will. <hi>If I be a maſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6.</note> ſaith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>where is my feare?</hi> Whence it is plaine that all that are his ſeruants ought to feare to deſpiſe his name, as the Prieſts there did, and to diſpleaſe the moſt high. Now two motiues there are which may perſwade vs vnto this reuerent and carefull walking in the whole courſe of our life, and feare to diſpleaſe him. The one is this, his eyes alwaies behold vs, whatſoeuer wee doe is naked before him, hee knoweth the very thoughts of our hearts before wee doe conceiue them, and there is nothing hid from him. This ſurely ſhould make vs watch euen ouer our thoughts, it ſhould make vs carefull in all our waies that we doe not any thing whereby we may grieue his holy ſpirit. And if we kept this alwaies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that whatſoeuer we doe God ſees vs, it would ſtay oftentimes euen the beſt of vs from many things which we doe. For therefore it is that we fall into many noyſome luſts, that we defile our ſelues with much filthineſſe of the world, that by many ſinnes we diſpleaſe our God, becauſe we thinke not of his preſence and forget that he ſees vs. Which of vs is there that in our Princes preſence would not, feare to diſpleaſe him? How much more ought we to feare to diſpleaſe our God, in whoſe preſence we are alwaies, and who behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whatſoeuer we doe? Euen the regard of his maieſtie,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:599:218"/> before whom we ſtand, ſhould cauſe vs to walke before him with feare and trembling. The other motiue to perſwade vs vnto a reuerent and carefull walking, as fearing to diſpleaſe our God, is this, the quicke and eagle-ſighted eyes of the wicked are euer prying and looking into all our waies, that they may haue ſome aduantage againſt vs, whereby they may take occaſion to diſhonor our God, and to ſpeake ill both of vs, and of the Goſpell which we profeſſe. This alſo ſhould make vs watchfull ouer all our waies, that thereby we do not offend and diſpleaſe our God. <hi>Haue your conuerſation honest,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>among the Gentiles, that they which ſpeake euill of you, as of euill doers, may by your good workes which they ſhall ſee glorifie God in the day of the viſitation.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaw that the Gentiles, among whom they liued, were ready to picke a quarrell at euery litle thing wherein they offended, thereby to diſhonor God, and to diſcredit the Goſpell. And therefore he exhorted them to looke vnto their conuerſation, that therby God might be glorified amongſt the Gentiles. And ſurely the Gentiles then were not more prying into the waies of Chriſtians, then the wicked and vngodly of the earth now are into the waies of Gods children. For if they tread awry, if they through the malice of Sathan, or the infirmitie of the fleſh, or the deceitfulnes of ſin ſlip out of the right way, wherin they ſhould walke, by and by the wicked haue it, and with open mouth they cry, theſe be our pure and holy men, theſe be our great profeſſors of the Goſpell, theſe be the men that would be counted the onely religious men. How carefull then ought we to be of our conuerſation, euen in regard of the watchfull eye of the wicked, that we doe or ſay nothing, whereby they may take aduantage againſt vs, or occaſion to diſhonor God, or to ſpeake ill of the Goſpell? Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we regard the maieſtie of our God, whoſe eyes alwaies behold vs; or the quicke eyes of the wicked which narrowly eſpy into our waies, we ſee that we ought to <hi>paſſe the time of our dwelling here in feare,</hi> and to <hi>make an end of our ſaluation with feare and trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ought we then thus to walke before the Lord with feare and trembling? Here then are two extremities, which are as
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:599:218"/> two cancres of the ſoule, to be looked vnto; the one, carnall ſecuritie, thother vaine preſumption. For ſuch is Satans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, that firſt he laboureth to make vs careleſſe of doing that is good; and then if he cannot ſo deceiue vs, he taketh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, and laboureth to make vs proud of that good which we doe. But we ought to walke before the Lord with feare and trembling, therefore firſt we ought not to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of doing that is good, but ſtill we ought to feare leſt our Lord and Maſter come in an houre when we ſhall be found doing no good. It was the fault of thoſe diſperſed Iewes vnto whom <hi>Iames</hi> wrote, that they boaſted too much of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and were too brag of their faith, but were altogether careleſſe of doing thoſe good workes wherein God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined them to walke. And I wiſh it were not a fault in our daies, that men did now but too much content themſelues with the names onely of faith, and religion, and were too careleſſe of doing that which is good. But beloued, let vs know that if we beleeue in God we muſt walke before him in holineſſe of life with feare and trembling. We muſt not be careleſſe to doe good, but we muſt be carefull to ſhew forth good works, as the Apoſtle telleth vs. This feare wherein we muſt walke muſt expell all careleſneſſe in walking.<note place="margin">

Paſſe the time therefore, I beſeech you, of your dwelling here, in feare, and walke in thoſe good workes which God hath ordained you to walke in, with feare and trembling, with feare (I ſay) and trembling, both in regard of the maieſtie of God, whoſe eyes alwayes behold vs, leſt you diſpleaſe him; and in regard of the wicked, whoſe eyes are prying into whatſoeuer wee doe, that they may haue no aduantage againſt you. Grieue not the holy ſpirit, either by carnall ſecuritie and careleſneſſe to doe that good which yee ſhould, or by vaine and proud preſumption of the worth of that good which yee doe, but walke before the Lord as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the Saints of God, with feare and trembling, fearing not to doe good, and trembling at the good which yee doe, leſt either not doing that good which yee ought, or preſuming of that good which yee doe, yee diſpleaſe him who loueth you, and in whoſe loue is life and ioy for euermore. And let this be ſpoken touching the manner how wee ought to walke and to finiſh our courſe. Now followeth the reaſon why wee ought thus to walke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For it is God which worketh, &amp;c.]</hi> This is the reaſon why wee ought not ſimply to make an end of our owne ſaluation, but to make an end of our owne ſaluation with feare and trembling: <hi>with feare and trembling,</hi> why? <hi>For it is God which worketh, &amp;c.</hi> Neither the will nor the deed in any thing well done is from our ſelues, that we ſhould be puffed vp with any pride thereof, but from the Lord; and therefore when hee guides vs, wee ſhould not be ſecure to follow. <hi>It is God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that worketh in you both the will:</hi> the will, how? not by helping the weakneſſe of our will, as if being a little holpen by grace, it were in vs to will that is good; but by ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying our corrupt will, that whereas before it was wholly and only inclined vnto euill, now it loueth, and liketh, and followeth after that which is good: <hi>and the deed,</hi> how? by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:599:219"/> grace to doe that good, to the deſire whereof hee hath ſanctified our will. It is then as if the Apoſtle ſhould thus haue ſaid: Walke in well-doing before the Lord, but with feare and trembling; why? for it is not in you either to will or to doe that is good, but it is God that firſt ſanctifieth your wils, to deſire the things that belong vnto your peace, to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, to acknowledge and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your ſinnes, and the like, and afterwards giueth grace to beleeue and to liue according to God in Chriſt Ieſus. Whence are many leſſons for vs.</p>
                  <p>Here then firſt that doctrine of free will is vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. If wee will or doe any thing that is good, <hi>it is God that worketh in vs both the will and the deed.</hi> Whoſoeuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall tell you, that wee haue power in our ſelues to will and to doe that which is good, and that wee need only to bee holpen, but not wholly aſſiſted by grace, beleeue him not. For I aske what it is that is left vnto vs, when both the will to doe good, and the deed it ſelfe, are giuen vs of God? If it be God that worketh in vs both the will and deſire to doe good, and likewiſe the grace of doing that which is good, then what is it that wee can challenge vnto our ſelues? If it had beene ſaid, that God is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end of euery good thing that wee doe, then happily ſome ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-hole might haue beene found. But when it is ſaid, that it is God that worketh in vs both to will and to do that which is good, out of doubt all power is taken from vs of doing any thing that is good. True it is, that <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall had free will to chuſe the good, and to refuſe the euill: but by his fall he loſt that which in his creation he had, euen all free will vnto all the things of the ſpirit; ſo that till ſuch time as hee bee regenerate by the ſpirit of God, he cannot at all by his owne power vnderſtand, thinke, will, or doe any thing that is good, but is wholly and only carried to that which is euill, and can doe nothing elſe but ſinne, lying bound in the chaines of ſinne, not as a man fettered, which hath a deſire to be looſe, but of himſelfe naturally willing and deſirous ſo to lie. <hi>The naturall man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>perceiueth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>neither can he know
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:599:220"/> them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Where the Apoſtle vnderſtanding by the naturall man, the vnregenerate man, whoſe knowledge and vnderſtanding the Lord ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h not yet cleared and lightened by his holy ſpirit, plainly ſheweth, that the vnregenerate man hath none vnderſtanding at all in the wayes of God, and the things that belong vnto his peace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can haue till the Lord ſanctifie him by his holy ſpirit, changing his corrupt will, and working in him both the will and the deed. Many Scriptures might be brought for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging and further proofe of this point: but by that which hath beene ſpoken yee ſee what the truth is in the point, namely that it is not in our owne power at all to will or doe that which is good, but that it is God which worketh in vs both the will and the deed, ſo that the thing which wee doe is no further good, than it is wholly guided and directed by the ſpirit of God. Take heed therefore and beware of ſuch as tell you otherwiſe than as yee haue now heard and learned, that yee be not deceiued by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence wee are taught whence all our ſufficiencie and all our ſtrength to walke in the wayes of God is, euen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> this is from the Lord, for he <hi>prepareth the heart.</hi> To thinke a good thought, this is from the Lord, for <hi>wee are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing as of our ſelues, but all our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> To will and deſire that which is good, and to doe that which is good, is likewiſe from the Lord, <hi>for it is God that worketh in vs both the will and the deed.</hi> So true is that of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Without mee yee can doe nothing.</hi> Where the meaning is not only that wee are ſo weake that we are not able of our ſelues to doe any thing that is good, vnleſſe we be aſſiſted by grace; but that wee are no more able than the branch that is pluckt from the tree is able to bring forth fruit. The ſumme of this point is, that the fruits of the ſpirit in vs are altogether from the ſpirit, euen as the fruits of the fleſh are altogether from the fleſh. Doeſt thou then at any time feele any good motions of the ſpirit within thee, any deſire to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:599:220"/> flie that which is euill, and to doe the thing that is good? Is thine heart enlarged to runne the way of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to glorifie thy Father which is in heauen? Are the bowels of thy compaſſion opened towards thy poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to releeue the neceſſities of Gods Saints? It is God that worketh in thee all theſe, and whatſoeuer is like vnto theſe; and they are ſo many teſtimonies vnto thee of Gods holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwelling within thee. Acknowledge therefore Gods mercy towards thee, who <hi>when thou waſt in thy bloud, ſaid vnto thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.</note> 
                     <hi>thou ſhalt liue;</hi> that is, who when thou waſt dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and hadſt no will to be raiſed from the dead ſleepe of ſinne whereinto thou waſt fallen, hath quickned thee by his ſpirit, and of vnwilling made thee willing to doe thoſe things that are good and acceptable in Gods ſight. Glorie not in any good thing that thou haſt, as though thou hadſt not receiued it. For when thou waſt as vnable to will or to doe any thing that is good, as the dead man is vnable to exerciſe any function of life, then did hee circumciſe the foreskinne of thine heart, and did not onely worke in thee a power to will and to doe the thing that is good, but gaue thee alſo grace both to will and to doe the thing that is good. Glorie therefore in thy God, let thy ſoule reioyce in him, and let his praiſes be euer in thy mouth. He it is that filleth thy heart with good deſires, and hee it is that directeth thy ſteps in the way wherein thou ſhouldeſt walke, and which leadeth vnto life. And why doth he ſhew ſuch mercy on vs? Euen of his good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euen of his good pleaſure.]</hi> Wee haue heard that it is God that worketh in vs both to will and to doe that which is good. And why doth he ſo? That God may be all in all, and all the glory of out ſaluation may be wholly his. The Apoſtle telleth vs, that this he doth euen of good pleaſure: it ſo pleaſeth him, and howſoeuer the cauſe or this his pleaſure be hidden from vs, yet it is good, and iuſt, hee doth it euen of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Here then wee haue the firſt and furtheſt cauſe euen of the whole myſterie of our ſaluation. Hee hath predeſtinated and choſen vs vnto eternall life through Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">

Hee hath not done theſe things for any good thing which hee ſaw in thee, or for any goodneſſe which hee foreſaw would be in thee, not for thy birth, wealth, ſex, or condition, but euen of his good pleaſure: for looke into the whole booke of God, ſtill thou ſhalt finde that the laſt and great cauſe of all our good is his grace, his mercy, his loue, his purpoſe, his will, the purpoſe of his will, his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the good pleaſure of his will.

                  <p>Is there then nothing in vs to moue him, but is it euen of his good pleaſure that he ſaueth vs, and that he doth ſo great things for vs?

And how could this gift be more free, than to haue it giuen vs euen of his good pleaſure, without reſpect of any thing that was or might be in vs? Let vs then with all thankfulneſſe yeeld all obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſo mercifull a God, who hath done ſo great things for vs, euen becauſe his good pleaſure was ſuch. Hee hath giuen vs all: let him haue the glory of all. Neither can we attribute

Whatſoeuer good thought, whatſoeuer good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, whatſoeuer good deed is in vs, he of his good pleaſure hath wrought it in vs, and he is to be glorified in it, and for it.

Now followeth another branch of the Apoſtle his exhortation, vpon the ſame ground of Chriſt his humilitie and obedience, and this is vnto an humble and modeſt conuerſation towards our neighbour, towards our brethren, in theſe words, <hi>Doe all things without murmuring, &amp;c.</hi> For as the example of Chriſt his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and obedience ſhould ſtirre vs vp vnto all humble obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto our God, to walke before him feare and with trembling; ſo ought it likewiſe to perſwade vs vnto all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and modeſt conuerſation toward our brethren, laying aſide all ſecret murmuring, and all contentious reaſonings, and with meekneſſe euery one yeelding one vnto another, and euery one forbearing one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doe all things without murmuring, &amp;c.]</hi> Theſe words you ſee are a dehortation and diſſwaſion from things to be eſchewed, and by conſequent they are an exhortation vnto things to bee
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:599:222"/> embraced. Two things there are, you ſee, which the Apoſtle diſſwadeth, the one murmuring, the other reaſonings. By murmuring the Apoſtle (I take it) in this place doth not ſo much meane murmuring againſt God, as ſecret grudgings in our ſelues againſt our brethren, and priuie whiſperings, ſuch as cloſely runne from hand to hand, to defame or to diſgrace thoſe whom wee like not. By reaſonings are meant ſuch open diſcords and contentions as thoſe ſecret grudgings and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie whiſperings doe for the moſt part breake out into. Both theſe faults the Apoſtle would haue auoided and eſchewed amongſt men one towards another, that neither there ſhould be ſecret grudgings and priuie whiſperings one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither there ſhould be open quarrelling or contending one with another. Now it is further to be vnderſtood, that in this dehortation from theſe faults the Apoſtle implieth an exhortation to thoſe good vertues whereby theſe bad faults may be redreſſed, namely vnto a modeſt conuerſation with our brethren, and a peaceable agreement with all men. When the Apoſtle therefore ſaith, <hi>Doe all things without murmuring,</hi> it is as if he had thus ſaid: Let there be no ſecret grudgings amongſt you one againſt another, nor any priuie whiſperings running cloſely from hand to hand, to defame or to diſgrace one another; but let euery one amongſt you approue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto another, in all modeſtie of conuerſation, modeſtly yeelding vnto his ſuperiour, and equall, and willingly making himſelfe equall vnto them of the loweſt degree. Againe, when he ſaith, <hi>Doe all things without reaſonings,</hi> it is as if hee had thus ſaid: Let there bee no open diſcords or contentions amongſt you, either through bearing out your ſelues one aboue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or vpon any occaſion what elſe ſoeuer; but follow peace and loue with all men, and doe all things with patience and mildneſſe. This I take to bee the meaning of theſe words. Now before wee proceed vnto the opening of the reſt that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, let vs ſee what vſe wee may make of this exhortation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doe all things without murmuring.]</hi> The firſt thing which the Apoſtle here diſſwadeth is murmuring. Now wee reade of two ſorts of murmurers in the holy Scriptures: the one of ſuch as murmur againſt the moſt high God, Lord of heauen
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:599:222"/> and earth. So wee reade that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> often murmured,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 21.5.11.5.</note> ſometimes for want of water, ſometimes for want of bread, ſometimes for want of the cucumbers, and the pepons, and the leekes, and the onions, and the garleeke, and the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and for want of ſuch things as cauſed their often murmurings, it is ſaid that they returned in their hearts into <hi>Egypt.</hi> And ſuch murmurers againſt God at this day are they who in this our time of want of bread, either breake out into ſuch impatient ſpeeches as theſe; What meanes the Lord to kill vs with famine? what greater ſinners are wee than ſuch and ſuch that haue the world at will, and all things at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? Would God hee would either mend theſe things, or make an end of vs: who can endure ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But what was the end of thoſe murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers amongſt the children of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Some of them were con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſumed by fire from heauen, others were ſmitten with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great plague, others died being bitten and ſtung with fierie ſerpents; and of all of them this was true, that none of them came into the promiſed land. A fearfull end vpon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers againſt God: ſome die one way, and others are ſlaine another way, euery one hath a fearfull end, and neuer a one comes into the promiſed land, neuer a one enters into that heauenly reſt, where only is reſt and ioy for euermore. As therefore the Apoſtle exhorted the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10</note> 
                     <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur not as ſome of the children of Iſrael murmured, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied of the deſtroier;</hi> ſo I ſay vnto you, Take heede that none of you be found murmurers againſt God either for this his iudgement, whereby hee now doth moſt iuſtly viſit our ſinnes and our iniquities vpon vs, or for any thing elſe, leſt his wrath bee kindled againſt you, and there bee none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer you. For all theſe things whereof wee haue ſpoke, came vnto the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for enſamples, and were
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:599:223"/> written to admoniſh vs vpon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of murmurers there are, which murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their brethren, grudging either at their wealth, or at the loue and fauour, or at the credit and preferment wherein they go before them, and cloſely ſeeking their diſcredit, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering amongſt their neighbours whatſoeuer euill they can deuiſe againſt them. So the Euangeliſts euery where teſtifie that the Scribes and Phariſes murmured againſt Ieſus, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Diſciples, becauſe they ſaw that the people fell eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where vnto them, and followed them.

And this principally is that murmuring which our Apoſtle in this place would haue abandoned, that wee ſhould not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne one another, that we ſhould not haue any grudgings or heartburnings within our ſelues one againſt another, that we ſhould not ſecretly and cloſly ſeeke the diſcredit or diſgrace one of another. A fault whether more bad, or more common it is hard to ſay, and that euen amongſt neighbours, amongſt brethren. For what more ordinary then one neighbour for ſome cauſe or other to murmure againſt another? If hee be our ſuperiour in wealth, or in honour, or in credit, wee mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt him as too great to dwell ſo neere vs, and be hee neuer ſo kinde vnto vs yet ſtill we doe imagine that hee beares himſelfe too much vpon his wealth, or vpon his birth, or vpon his place &amp;c. and ouerlookes vs. If hee be our equall, wee grudge that hee ſhould come forward as well as our ſelues, that he ſhould be as much honoured, that hee ſhould be as much loued, that he ſhould be as well cuſtomed as our ſelues. If he be our inferiour, wee diſdaine him, and that liuelihood which he hath wee wiſh vnto our ſelues, and would be content that hee ſhould ſhift as he could. Thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all ſorts there is murmuring, and grudging, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining; ſo that whereas all things ſhould bee done without murmuring, nothing is done without murmuring. Yea, and which is the vile malice of this diſeaſe, if happily ſometimes there be ſome iuſt cauſe, we ſpeake not of it, we do not friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:599:223"/> and neighbourly expoſtulate things one with another, but we make faire weather outwardly, when as yet both we foſter within our ſelues ill conceits and opinions one of another, and likewiſe whiſper one with another ſuch things as tend to the diſgrace one of another. Now ſee the roote whence this murmuring ſprings: ſurely it ſprings euen from an euill and a cankered minde within our ſelues which makes vs that wee cannot brooke any of any ſort, but whatſoeuer their place be, ſuperiour, equall, or inferiour to vs we mutter and we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient towards them, and whatſoeuer almoſt is done on ſaid we take occaſion to be offended thereat. And ſuch as is the roote whence it ſprings, ſuch is the fruit which it brings forth, both bad, and exceeding bad. For howſoeuer we do ſmother and ſuppreſſe it for a time, and carry it ſo cloſly that he whom we grudge at ſuſpect nothing by vs; yet will it moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end burſt out like a flame, into brawles, and heates, and open contentions, and diſcords, and the more cloſely the fire hath beene couered, the more vehemently it will breake out. It behoueth vs therefore carefully to looke vnto it that we be not tainted with this fault, and if there be any ſuch root of bitterneſſe in any of vs to weede it out. Let euery man looke into his owne heart, and examine himſelfe how this may concerne him: and this with the Apoſtle I exhort that ye doe all things without murmuring. Be not ready to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at euery ſmall fault one with another, foſter not within your ſelues any ill opinions, or conceits one of an other; whiſper not any thing amongſt your ſelues which may tend to the diſcredit, or diſgrace one of another; grudge not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any duty euery man in his place one vnto an other. But contrariwiſe let euery man approue himſelfe in all modeſtie of conuerſation one vnto another; let euery man thinke well one of another; let euery man yeeld one vnto another; let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man beare one with another; and let all things be done with cheerefulneſſe and modeſtie. For this yee muſt know, that he that diſſwadeth murmuring amongſt neighbours and brethren, doth withall deſire that all cheerefulnes and louing kindneſſe be maintained amongſt them. Haue your conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation then one with an other with all cheerefulneſſe and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:599:224"/> kindneſſe, and doe all things that any way concerne your duties one vnto an other without murmuring, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without reaſoning: for ſo it followeth in the next place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And reaſonings]</hi> This is the ſecond thing which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle diſſwadeth, that wee ſhould fall to reaſonings about any thing that we doe. 1. That we ſhould fall vnto open brawling or quarrelling, or contentions one with another. Wee read that when there was fallen a debate between the heardmen of <hi>Abrahams</hi> cattell, and the heardmen of <hi>Lots</hi> cattell, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Lot,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.7.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Let there be no ſtrife, no brawling or falling out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene mee and thee, neither betweene mine heardmen, and thine heardmen: for we be brethren.</hi> See how carefull <hi>Abraham</hi> was to ſtay all contention and brawels. He was <hi>Lots</hi> elder, and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſo his better in that reſpect, but he ſtandeth not vpon that; neither doth he hearten his ſeruants, and ſet them on, as the manner of ſome is, but he goes vnto <hi>Lot,</hi> and talkes with him of the matter, and that not hotly, but kindly and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with great meekneſſe of loue, and requeſts him that there may be no brawling or contention betweene their ſeruants, or betwixt themſelues; and to that purpoſe he both vſeth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to perſwade thereunto, and yeeldeth of his right rather then there ſhould be any ſuch betwixt them. Whereby you ſee this holy Patriarches iudgement of them: rather then he would haue any brawles and contentions with his brother, he would reſigne that right vnto him which hee might rightly haue chalenged vnto himſelfe. Now what account the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes of brawling and contention, and diſcords of men one with another, ye may cleerely ſee by thoſe notable fruits of the fleſh wherewith he ſorteth this fault whereof wee now ſpeake,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20.</note> as namely, <hi>with adulterie, fornication, idolatrie, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, hereſie, murther, drunkeneſſe, gluttony,</hi> and ſuch like. Ye ſee then what vice it is from whence the Apoſtle here diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, when he diſſwadeth vs from reaſonings, and brawles, and contentions one with an other; euen from that which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> by his example hath taught vs to redeeme with the loſſe of our owne right, and from that which the Apoſtle ſorteth amongſt the moſt vgly monſters which reigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. And theſe brawlings, and contentions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:599:224"/> are the fruits which follow thoſe murmurings, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie grudgings whereof we ſpake before. For as wood and fewell is vnto the fire, ſo are thoſe cloſe murmurings vnto theſe open brawles and contentions, euen the very ground and matter whereout they do ſpring: and as the fire long co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and ſmothered is not alwaies kept vnder but at length burſteth out into a flame; ſo thoſe concealed hatreds howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer for a time they lie boyling within the breaſt of him that foſtereth them, yet do they at length ſhew themſelues in their colours, euen breaking out into open ſtrifes and contentions. It ſtandeth vs vpon to ſtrangle both the mother, and the daughter, to auoide both the one, and the other, leaſt yeelding poſſeſſion in our hearts vnto the one wee our ſelues be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and ſtrangled with the other. And to this end as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle before exhorted vs to doe all things without murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſo now to do all things without reaſonings and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions one wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let not euery fooliſh and flying word, euery toying and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling matter breede brawles, or kindle the coles of diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt you.

Beware therefore I beſeech you that yee ſuffer not this canker to ſpread amongſt you. Brawling and debate, ſtriefe &amp; contention becomes not them that haue giuen their names to Chriſt Ieſus. Peace and loue, kindneſſe and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe one towards another beſt beſeemeth you. Follow therefore after loue, ſeeke peace, and enſue it.

                     <hi>That ye may be blameleſſe, and pure &amp;c.]</hi> Now followeth the reaſon, as I take it, of both the branches of the Apoſtle his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation; namely why we ſhould both walke in holines of life before the Lord with feare and trembling, and why our conuerſation with our neigbours and brethen ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring and reaſonings. The reaſon is twofold: the one in reſpect of the <hi>Philippians, that they might be blameleſſe, and pure &amp;c.</hi> the other in reſpect of the Apoſtle himſelfe, <hi>that he might reioyce in the day of Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> The ſumme of the firſt reaſon in reſpect of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and conſequently in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of vs, is this; we ought to lead a life as the ſons of God in the middeſt of a froward people, therefore we ought to paſſe the time of our dwelling heare with feare and trembling, and to doe all things without murmuring and reaſoning. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeemeth to be drawne from the end why wee ſhould ſo walke, why wee ſhould ſoe doe. Why ſhould we ſo walk, why ſhould we ſo do? to what end? that we may be blameleſſe &amp;c that is in briefe, that we may be as the ſonnes of God in the middeſt of a froward people. But the particulars whereby this is enlarged haue their ſeuerall vſes, and are very well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our ſerious conſideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ye may be blameleſſe]</hi> we muſt walke thus, and doe thus that we may be blameleſſe that is, that we may not giue vnto any any iuſt cauſe of complaining of vs, or blaming vs. And this is ſet downe for vs as a marke to ſhoote at, whereat in our life we muſt leuel as neere as poſſible we can, euen to liue without blame and reproofe amongeſt men. Yea but is
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:599:225"/> this poſſible? Could our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, or could his Apoſtles and Diſciples eſcape the reproofe and hatred of the <hi>Iewes?</hi> No, they could not: neither can we. For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himſelfe, hath told vs, that the world, i. the wicked men of the world ſhall hate vs, aad ſpeake all manner of euill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs for his ſake, falſly.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.25.</note> Yet therefore were they blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> hated them without a cauſe, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith of himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.6.</note> becauſe there was no iuſt cauſe of their reproofe. And ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife, that they walked in all the commandements and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord without reproofes. Without reproofe: how? in reſpect of God? no: but in reſpect of men they were without reproofe, inaſmuch as they gaue no iuſt cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt them vnto any man. And this is it whereunto we muſt bend our ſelues, and our ſtudies, euen ſo to liue as that we giue no iuſt occaſion of offence or complaint of vs vnto any man either by word, or by deede. Yea, but this alſo is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, ſo to liue as not to giue many times iuſt occaſions of offences, iuſt occaſions of reproofes. True it is: for who is he that liues ſo well, that giues not iuſt occaſions of reproofes? But what then? muſt we not therefore ſtudy ſo to liue as not to giue any iuſt occaſion of reproofe? Our Sauiour Chriſt telleth vs that we muſt be perfect euen as our Father which is in heauen is perfect. A thing altogether impoſſible for vs to be perfect in this life. Yet muſt we euen in this life ſtriue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that though we cannot come as farre as wee ſhould, yet we may endeauour to come as farre as we can; euen as our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle witneſſeth of himſelfe, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>I forget that which is behinde, and endeauour to that which is before, and follow hard toward the marke &amp;c.</hi> Where he plainely ſheweth that though he could not come vnto perfection yet he laboured thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Right ſo, although we cannot be blameleſſe, nor happily without iuſt occaſion of blame and reproofe, yet muſt wee ſtudie and endeauour ſo to liue amongſt men as that neither by word not by deede wee giue them iuſt occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of vs, or to blame vs. But how farre a great many in theſe laſt and worſt daies are from this ſtudy and endeauour, he ſeeth little that ſeeth not. When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>doe all
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:599:226"/> things without murmuring and reaſonings, that yee may be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe;</hi> he ſheweth plainely that thoſe that are tainted with thoſe faults of murmuring, and brawling, and contention, are not blameleſſe, but are iuſtly to be reproued, giuing iuſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof by their wranglings, and malecontented contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To go one ſteppe further, the profane ſwearer is he ſuch a ſtudent as now we ſpeake of, doth hee ſtudy to be without iuſt reproofe? Nay reproue him for his curſed ſwearing a thing moſt worthy reproofe, yet reprooue him, and great oddes but he will heape oath vpon oath to let you know how little he eſteemes iuſt reproofe. I ſpeake that I know, hauing ſomtimes my ſelfe to my great grife heard it. And if we ſhould go farther, how few ſuch ſtudents ſhould wee finde as ſtudie to be blameleſſe? ye your ſelues do ſee it, and finde it in the ordinary courſe of life, and common experience. Well, let vs know that not only Scholers ought to be ſuch ſtudents as now we ſpeake of, but all generally of what ſort or ſtate ſoeuer they be ought to ſtudy ſo to lead their liues as that they may want iuſt reproofe amongſt their brethren. And if we ought, then let vs be ſuch ſtudents, and let euery of vs ſet ſuch a watch before our lips that we may not offend with our tong, and ſo order our ſteps that we giue no iuſt occaſion of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt vs, that ſo we may come as neere vnto this of our Apoſtle as we can to be blameleſſe.</p>
                  <p>The next clauſe is, that <hi>we may be pure.</hi> We muſt walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God with feare and trembling, and we muſt do all things with our neighbour without murmuring and grudging, that we may be pure, that is, that in our ſpirits there may be found no guile, but that in ſingleneſſe of heart wee may ſpeake and doe whatſoeuer we ſpeake or doe. And this is ſet downe as an other marke for vs to ſhoote at, whereat likewiſe wee muſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſo neere as we can in the whole courſe of our life, euen to be pure and cleane from all fraude &amp; guile both in our words and deedes. And if we hit this marke wee ſhall not miſſe of the other, if we be pure we ſhall be blameleſſe, if whatſoeuer we ſpeake or doe proceede from the ſingleneſſe of a ſincere heart we ſhall auoide all luſt reproofe for whatſoeuer wee ſay or do. That therefore we may be blameleſſe we ought to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:599:226"/> to be pure from all contagion of ſinne. Yea but the ſtars are vncleane in his ſight: how much more man, a worme, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſonne of man which is but a worme: and he hath laid folly vpon his Angels, how much more vpon vs that dwell in houſes of clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt, which ſhall be deſtroyed before the moth? True it is, none can ſay I haue made mine heart cleane, I am cleane from my ſinne, but if God ſhould diſpute with vs wee could not anſwere him one thing of a thouſand. Yet ought wee to endeauour to be pure euen from all contagion of ſinne, and to keepe our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted of the world. And if ſo, then ought we to be ſimple, and ſincere, and plaine dealing in all our words and workes,<note place="margin">

Our ſpeach ought to be ſimple, yea, and nay, and we our ſelues ought to be ſimple, and pure in heart, that both in word and in worke wee may be found ſincere, and intire.

Our labour and endeuour muſt be, that we may know our ſelues to be the ſonnes of God, and that others may alſo know that wee are the ſonnes of God.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Giue all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> In which words of the Apoſtle, yee ſee how carefully the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would haue vs to be imployed in this ſtudie: hee would haue vs to giue all diligence hereunto, that we may be ſure that wee are the ſonnes of God, elect and choſen in Chriſt Ieſus before the foundation of the world. Our election it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good purpoſes of his will, who hath predeſtinated vs vnto eternall ſaluation. Our adoption likewiſe into the ſonnes of God through Ieſus Chriſt, it is according to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his grace and fauour towards vs. And theſe things, euen our election, and adoption into the ſonnes of God, are moſt ſure in themſelues, neither can they by vs any way bee procured either to be if they be not, or being, to be more ſure than they be. For whom hee hath choſen and adopted into ſonnes, them he hath choſen and adopted before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and his decree is beyond all degrees of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon more vnalterable and vnchangeable than are the lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> Yet ſuch are the mercies of our God towards vs, that howſoeuer wee can helpe nothing vnto our election, or vnto our adoption into the ſonnes of
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:599:228"/> God, yet may wee know whether we be elected, whether we be the ſonnes of God, and beſides we may giue proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto others. And hereunto it is that wee ought to giue all diligence, and to bend our ſelues and our whole ſtudies, that it may appeare both vnto our ſelues, and vnto others, that we are the ſonnes of God. A ſtudie whereunto the comfort which thence may ariſe may be a ſufficient inducement vnto any. For wherein ſhould wee rather labour than in that wherein wee may take the greateſt comfort? Or wherein can we take ſo great comfor as in this, that wee know that we are, and that it doth appeare vnto others that wee are the ſonnes of God? Herein alone is ſound ioy and comfort, and without this what can there be elſe but reſtleſneſſe of thoughts, and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe of minde?</p>
                  <p>Yea but you will aske mee how this may appeare either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues or others, that wee are the ſonnes of God? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer out of the Apoſtles, euen by walking without rebuke in the middeſt of a naughtie and crooked nation, by the fruits of the ſpirit ſhewing themſelues in the holineſſe of our conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.</note> 
                     <hi>For as many as are lead by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſonnes of God.</hi> Now who are they that are lead by the ſpirit of God? Euen they that by the power of the ſpirit of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mortifie the deeds of the body, as there the Apoſtle ſheweth, and bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit. So then they which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, flying from ſinne as from a Serpent, and being zealous of good workes, they haue an infallible teſtimonie that they are the ſonnes of God, and heires of eternall life. Hereby then wee our ſelues know that wee are the ſonnes of God, euen by the fruits of the ſpirit, which hee hath giuen vs. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> in the place before alleadged, <hi>Giue diligence to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> immediately addeth, <hi>For if yee doe theſe things,</hi> that is, if yee bring forth thoſe fruits mentioned before, <hi>ye ſhall neuer fall.</hi> Where the Apoſtles plainly ſheweth, that the way to confirme our election vnto our ſelues, is by the fruits of the ſpirit which he hath giuen vs. Hereby likewiſe wee make it apparant vnto others that wee are the ſonnes of God, if wee walke in thoſe good workes which God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:599:228"/> vs to walke in. And therefore our Sauiour Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs, ſaying, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16.</note> 
                     <hi>that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> euen him whoſe ſonnes they ſhall know you to bee by thoſe good workes which they ſhall ſee you doe. So that as the end wherefore wee were predeſtinate to bee adopted into the ſonnes of God through Ieſus Chriſt, was that wee ſhould be holy, and without blame before God in loue; ſo the meanes whereby wee are declared both to our ſelues and others to be the ſonnes of God, is our holy conuerſation, and walking without rebuke in the middeſt of a naughtie and crooked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When therefore I ſay that we ought to giue all diligence that we may appeare to be the ſonnes of God, the meaning is, that we ought to be holy in conuerſation, and without blame in the middeſt of a naughtie and crooked nation, that ſo it may appeare that wee are the ſonnes of God.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but here againe it will be ſaid, where is he that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all manner of conuerſation? And who is he that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without rebuke amongſt the ſonnes of men? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how can it appeare by the note of our ſanctification that we are the ſonnes of God? I anſwer, that howſoeuer our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification here in this life be ſo vnperfit, that we cannot be holy in all manner of conuerſation, or walke without rebuke amongſt the ſonnes of men, yet if we ſtriue and labour, if we ſtudie and endeuour to be holy without blame, and to walke as the ſonnes of God amongſt the ſonnes of men, hereby it doth and may appeare that we are the ſonnes of God. If we hate the ſinnes of vnfaithfulnes, and let no ſuch cleane vnto vs; if we ſuffer not ſinne to reigne in our mortall bodies, but ſtriue to ſubdue the fleſh vnto the ſpirit; if we flie the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are in the world through luſts, and ſtudie to liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; if wee long and thirſt after thoſe things that belong vnto our peace, and can in the needfull time of trouble come vnto our God, and cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> hereby it doth and may appeare that we are the ſonnes of God. The godly ſtrife againſt ſinne, and carefull deſire of walking in the waies of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, they are the ſure and vndoubted ſtampes of the ſpirit
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:599:229"/> of our adoption into the ſonnes of God, and the certaine fruits of that ſpirit whereby we are ſealed vntill the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the poſſeſſion purchaſed vnto the praiſe of his glory.

For to turne a litle aſide vnto the ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> &amp; children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, what ſtrife or fight at all is there in them betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit? what denying of vngodlines and worldly luſts? what care to ſubdue the fleſh vnto the ſpirit? what flying of the corruptions which are in the world through luſts? what loue of God or good men? what deſire to liue ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly in this preſent world is in them at all? Nay contrariwiſe they delight in vnrighteouſnes, &amp; ſell themſelues to worke wickednes, they commit ſin euen with greedines, &amp; gladly giue their members ſeruants to vncleannes and to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie to commit iniquitie; they hate to be reformed, and caſt the word behind their backs; they refuſe to hearken to inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſtop their eares at the voice of the charmer charme he neuer ſo wiſely. And therefore the Apoſtles calleth them a naughty and crooked nation, becauſe they quite peruert the ſtraight waies of the Lord, giuing their members as weapons of vnrighteouſnes vnto ſin, which ſhould be giuen as weapons of righteouſnes vnto God. So farre they from ſtriuing againſt ſin, and from a deſire to walke holy &amp; without blame. Onely they that are the ſonnes of God feele this ſtrife, and this deſire within themſelues, and this very ſtrife againſt ſin, and deſire to walke after the ſpirit without blame in loue ſhewes plainely that we are the ſons of God. Thus then yee ſee what ſhould be our ſtudie in the whole courſe of our life, to wit, as that we may be blameleſſe, &amp; that we may be pure; ſo that we may be knowne to be the ſonnes of God euen vnto thoſe amongſt whom we liue. Ye ſee likewiſe how this may be known not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others only but vnto our ſelues, both vnto our ſelues &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, euen by the ſpirit of ſanctification,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 16.</note> which both <hi>witneſſeth vnto our ſpirits that we are the ſonnes of God,</hi> and which by the fruits and effects which it worketh in vs ſheweth aſmuch vnto others. And howſoeuer our ſanctification here in this life be vnperfit, yet yee ſee that our very ſtriuing againſt ſinne, and our deſire to be holy and without rebuke plainely doth
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:599:230"/> and may ſhew both vnto our ſelues, and vnto others that we are the ſonnes of God. Comfort then thy ſelfe, ô thou affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſoule whoſoeuer thou art, that ſo groneſt vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of thy ſinnes that thou wanteſt this ſweet comfort of thy ſoule. For tell me, doeſt thou feele in thy ſelfe a ſtriuing againſt ſinne; art thou touched with remorſe and compunction of heart for thy ſinnes; doeſt thou deſire to lead a life according to Gods will, and haſt thou a longing after this comfort that thou art the childe of God? Whatſoeuer be thine infirmities, how crimſon-died ſo euer thy ſinnes be, whatſoeuer doubts elſe thou calleſt, yet doubt not, thou art the ſonne of God, and vnto thee belongeth the inheritance of the ſonnes of God. For it is the ſpirit, euen the ſpirit of ſanctification that filleth thy heart with good deſires, with deſire to flie that which is euill,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6.</note> and with deſire to doe that which is good, and <hi>be that hath begun this good worke in thee will performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> when thou ſhalt be crowned with glory and immortalitie in the higheſt heauens. As for the wicked and vngodly of the earth which wallow in their wickedneſſe, and make a mocke of piety and religion, which haue not God in all their thoughts, nor make mention of his name with their lips, vnleſſe it be to blaſpheme and diſhonor his holy name, they haue no part in this comfort, this reioycing in the ſpirit belongeth not vnto them. But for vs, beloued, let vs labour and ſtriue to haue this comfort ſealed vnto our ſoules, that we are the ſonnes of God, by our ſtriuing againſt ſinne, and our carefull endeuour to walke without rebuke. Yea let vs ſo looke vnto our ſteps and take heede vnto our waies; let vs ſo decline the pleaſures of ſinne, and delight our ſelues in the law of the Lord, that men ſeeing the mortification of our earthly members, and the integritie of our conuerſation may haue nothing concerning vs to ſpeake euill of, but may ſay that God is in you indeede, and ſo may glorifie him in the day of viſitation.</p>
                  <p>Yea but yee will ſay againe vnto me, how can we thus liue? Is it not a naughty and crooked nation, a froward and wicked people with whom we liue? Can a man touch pitch and not be defiled therewith? or walke amongſt thornes and not be
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:599:230"/> pricked therewith? True: wee liue amongſt wicked men whoſe hearts are ſet on miſchiefe, euen as the Apoſtle here ſaith, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> liued in the middeſt of a naughty and crooked nation. Yet the Apoſtle yee ſee writeth vnto them to walke ſo both before God, and with their neighbour that they might be blameleſſe and pure, and the ſonnes of God without rebuke in the middeſt of a naughty and crooked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which teacheth vs thus much, that howſoeuer <hi>the whole wolrd lieth in wickednes,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.19.</note> yet may we liue in the world, and amongſt the enemies of the light, as children of the light, and as the ſonnes of God, ſhewing our ſelues to be ſo euen vnto them by walking with all care to be without rebuke amongſt them. Otherwiſe no doubt the Apoſtle would haue bid them to get out from amongſt that naughty and crooked people, that ſo being ſeparated from them they might not be defiled with their vncleane conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereas now he warneth them ſo to order their ſteps that they may be knowne to be the ſonnes of God by walking with all carefulnes to be without rebuke in the middeſt of a naught &amp; crooked nation. There is great danger indeed that we ſhall be defiled with pitch if we touch it, &amp; that we ſhall be pricked with thornes if we walke in the middeſt of thornes. Proofes hereof there are too too many in all places. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caught in the waies of God feared God no doubt:<note place="margin">

So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour willeth, ſaying, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Theſe I ſay are the precepts which if we follow, wee neede not to thinke of cloiſter, or of deſert, or of going out of the world, but we may liue with a pure conſcience, and as the ſonnes of God, be the ſonnes of men neuer ſo wicked amongſt whom we liue. This I ſay we may doe. Howbeit I doe not hereby encourage any either to thruſt himſelfe into the companie of the wicked when he neede not, or longer to ſtay amongſt them then he ſhould. But this I exhort, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that yee faſhion not your ſelues like vnto the wicked of the world; and next that yee auoide the company of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and vngodly. At no hand ſuffer your ſelues to be defiled by their vncleane conuerſation, and if yee may keepe your ſelues from their aſſemblies. In a word, ſtudie to be the ſons of God without rebuke in the middeſt of a naughty and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nation; and the more wicked that they are with whom yee liue, be yee the more carefull of your conuerſation, that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:599:232"/> it be ſuch as becommeth the ſonnes of God, that therby they may be drawne, if it be poſſible, to glorifie God in the day of viſitation, or at leaſt they may haue nothing concerning you to ſpeake euill of, alwaies remembring that by grace and adop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion we are ſeuered from them to be the ſons of God.</p>

<pb n="442" facs="tcp:599:233"/> crooked people with whom they liue, euen as lights which ſhine in darknes, and which hold forth the word of life to giue light to them that ſit in darknes: they are called lights, ſhining lights, lights ſhining in the midſt of a naughty and crooked nation, lights holding forth the word of life vnto others. The whole forme of ſpeach ſeemeth to be drawne from thoſe high places by the ſea-coaſt, whence continually lights and fires are ſet out for the direction of ſea-men into the hauen, and ſafeſt entrance. For euen ſuch the Apoſtle here commendeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> to be, lights which ſhined in holineſſe of life vnto them that ſate in darkneſſe round about them, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of which their light they might come into the hauen of euerlaſting reſt, where they might find reſt for their ſoules. Now let vs ſee what we may obſerue hence for our vſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that the Apoſtle calleth the <hi>Philippians</hi> light, I note the ſingular prerogatiue and honour of all the faithfull mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt Ieſus. For that which the Apoſtle here giueth to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> belongeth to all the faithfull. All the faithfull children of Chriſt are called lights, ſhining lights, lights ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the world. Now for our better inſtruction how they are called lights, we are to vnderſtand that there are foure ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall lights mentioned in the holy Scriptures. The 1. is that light, Chriſt Ieſus, the light of the world, and the brightneſſe of his father. This light by a principall prerogatiue is called that light, that true light which lighteth euery man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world, that ſonne of righteouſneſſe, that ſtarre of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that day ſpring from an high, that brightneſſe of his fathers perſon. 2. The word of God in many places of the Scriptures is tearmed a light, as where it is ſaid, <hi>Thy word ô Lord is a lanthorne vnto my feete,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</note> 
                     <hi>and a light vnto my pathes:</hi> As alſo where the godly are commended by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> for that they attend vnto the ſure word of the Prophets, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a light that ſhineth in a darke place. By this light the holy Ghoſt illuminateth the blindneſſe and darkneſſe of our groſſe vnderſtandings, and directeth vs in the waies of God which leade vnto ſaluation. 3. The Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus are called lights, as where our Sauiour ſaith vnto them, <hi>yee are the light of the world.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14.</note> Which glorious title is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:599:233"/> them, both becauſe of that teſtimonie which they giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that true light, the euerlaſting ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus, and becauſe of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus which they preach vnto vs. 4. All the faithfull members of Chriſt Ieſus, all Chriſtians are called lights: as where the Apoſtle telleth the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they were once darkenes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8.</note> but are now light in the Lord, and therefore exhorteth them <hi>to walke as chrildren of the light;</hi> and in this place of our Apoſtle, where they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>lights in the world, ſhining among the ſonnes of darkneſſe, and holding forth the word of life.</hi> Now the faithfull are called lights in theſe reſpects: 1. In reſpect of Chriſt Ieſus that true light which lighteneth euery man that commeth into the world, inaſmuch as he hath vouchſafed to communicate his light vnto vs, and by the bright beames of his holy Spirit ſhining into our hearts to expell thence the thicke miſts of blindnes, darkneſſe, and ignorance. For whatſoeuer light the faithfull haue they haue it from him, who hath light in himſelfe, and of himſelfe, and in whom is no darkneſſe. They borrow their light from him, euen as the Moone, and the ſtarres doe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their light from the Sunne in the firmament. For hee is the ſonne of righteouſneſſe which ſpringing from an high hath through the tender mercy of our God viſited vs, to giue light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feete into the way of peace, and ſo farre as this light ſhineth vnto them their darknes is turned into light, and they are tearmed lights of that light which they haue from this ſonne of righteouſneſſe. So that when the holy Ghoſt calleth the faithfull, lights, hee noteth therein the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip which they haue with Chriſt Ieſus, from whoſe moſt cleare light they borrow their light. 2. The faithfull are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led lights in reſpect of the word, inaſmuch as they beleeue, and embrace, and profeſſe the holy word of God which hee hath ordained to be a lanthorne vnto our feete, and a light vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſteps. For albeit it be the ſon of righteouſneſſe alone, by the bright ſhining beames of whoſe holy Spirit our darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is turned into light, and we made lights in the world; yet becauſe we receiue this light by the miniſterie of the word therefore both the word itſelfe is called light, and they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:599:234"/> that receiue the word with gladneſſe, and walke in the light thereof are called lights. For as much then as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profeſſe the holy word of God, ordained to bee the rule of our life, and our direction in matters of religion, in reſpect of this profeſſion they are called lights. 3. They are called lights in reſpect of their life and conuerſation, inaſmuch as by the holineſſe of their life, and integritie of their conuerſation they ſhew themſelues to be exempted and deliuered from the power of darkneſſe. Both their workes in reſpect of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull workes of darkneſſe are called lights, and themſelues glorifying God by theſe workes are called lights. Now ſee what inſtructions theſe things may miniſter vnto vs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that the faithfull are called lights, not from any light in themſelues as of themſelues, but from that light which they haue and borrow from Chriſt Ieſus that ſonne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, this may teach vs what we are without Chriſt Ieſus, euen darkneſſe without light, men ſitting in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death. For looke into the beſt things that wee haue. Our reaſon what is it but groſſe darkneſſe? our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome what is it but meere fooliſhneſſe? Our vnderſtanding what is it but blinde ignorance? for the naturall man, 1. Hee on whom this ſonne of righteouſneſſe hath not yet ſhined, perceiueth not,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note> nay he cannot perceiue by all the reaſon, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and vnderſtanding that he hath, the things of the ſpirit of God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8.</note> And therefore the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> telleth them thus, <hi>yee were once darkneſſe,</hi> to wit, before the ſonne of righteouſneſſe had ſhined vpon them, <hi>but are now light in the world,</hi> now that the ſonne of righteouſneſſe had ſhined vpon them their darkneſſe was turned into light. Where he moſt plainely ſheweth what is the ſtate of all men both before and after that the ſonne of righteouſneſſe haue ſhined vpon them: before, they are darkneſſe, after they are light. O what a good and gracious God then haue we, who when we ſate in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death gaue vs this light, and ſo tranſlated vs out of darkneſſe into light. Not vnto vs ô Lord, not vnto vs but vnto thy name giue the praiſe, for that thou haſt called vs out of darkneſſe into thy maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light. When we walked in darkeneſſe thou madeſt vs to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:599:234"/> ſee a great light, and when we dwelled in the land of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, thou diddeſt cauſe the light to ſhine vpon vs. We were once darkneſſe, but now we are light. Bleſſed bee thy name ô Lord which haſt changed our darkeneſſe into light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that the faithfull are called lights in reſpect of the word which they profeſſe, and in the light whereof they walk, this may teach vs how precious the holy word of God ought to be vnto vs. If walking after the direction of the word wee onely walke in the light, then iudge ye how we walke without the word. Surely without it we walke in darkneſſe, and know not whether we go, no more then the blinde or blind-folded man, who not diſcerning his way quickely wandereth out of his right path, and walketh into euery by-path, and runneth himſelfe vpon euery danger. For by the word alone we deſcry euery by-path, we ſee euery danger that is to be auoided, and vnderſtand the glory that is prepared for vs at the end of our iourney. And yet as if their we loued darkneſſe better then light, or elſe know not that by the miniſterie of the word of darkneſſe we are made light in the Lord, wee care not for the word, we regard it not, wee let it paſſe as a tale that is told. A hard ſaying truely: but yet as true as hard. For if we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our great ſlackneſſe in comming, or our great negligence in hearing, or our great careleſneſſe to lay vp in our hearts the things that we haue heard, all theſe will witneſſe what account we make of the word, euen no more then of a tale that is told. Otherwiſe how ſhould it be, which hath beene obſerued, that ſince this exerciſe begunne not halfe of that congregation which ſhould be here preſent haue beene aſſembled in this houſe of the Lord at any one Sermon. Againe, a great ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in comming of thoſe that doe come, howſoeuer they may be obſerued which either come too late, or depart too quickly from this holie exerciſe, yet who knoweth how many depart hence as little edified and inſtructed as when they came hither? A great negligence in hearing. Againe, who is he that hauing heard the word, doth afterward thinke or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate with himſelfe of the things that he hath heard, and lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them vp in his heart to make them the rule and direction
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:599:235"/> of his life? A great careleſneſſe to make that vſe we ſhould of that wee haue heard. And what elſe doe all theſe argue, but that we make no more account of the word than of a tale that is told? Well, whatſoeuer account we make of it, either we muſt walke in the light of this word, or elſe we cannot be ſuch lights as here the faithfull members of Chriſt Ieſus are ſaid to be: either this word muſt be a light vnto our paths, or elſe we can be no light in the Lord; either the Lord muſt goe before vs in this word, as in a pillar of fire, or elſe wee ſhall be made a prey vnto our enemies, the world, the fleſh, and the deuill, who ſeeketh continually like a roaring Lion whom hee may deuoure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that the faithfull are called lights in reſpect of their holy life and conuerſation, this may teach vs what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conuerſation will beſt become vs if wee will be lights in the world. The light of our holineſſe of life and integritie of conuerſation muſt ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good workes, and glorifie our Father which is in heauen <hi>Yee were once darkneſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians) but are now light in the Lord;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>walke as children of the light.</hi> In which words the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth, that being made lights, wee ought to walke as children of the light, approuing that which is pleaſing vnto the Lord, hauing no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, but reprouing them, if not by word, for that wee cannot all at all times doe, yet at leaſt by the example of our holy and vnblameable life. But of this wee ſhall haue more occaſion anon to ſpeake. Let this ſuffice to be ſpoken generally why the faithfull children of God are called lights, and of the inſtructions which the reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may miniſter vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here I note two qualities attributed to theſe lights mentioned by the Apoſtle: The firſt, they ſhine in the middeſt of darkneſſe, in the middeſt of a naughtie and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nation: Secondly, they hold out vnto others the light that is in them, euen the word of life, ſhewing it ſelfe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of their conuerſation. Whence I note two properties neceſſarily requiſite in all the faithfull children of God: the one is, that they haue light in themſelues, the other is, that
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:599:235"/> they communicate it to others. Touching the firſt, light yee know is not called light, vnleſſe it haue light in it ſelfe, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer darkneſſe it ſhine. The faithfull children of God then, if they will be, as here they are called, lights, they muſt ſtill ſo looke vnto themſelues and their owne wayes, that howſoeuer they walke amongſt the children of darkneſſe, yet they ſuffer not that light which is in them to be darkened, but that they ſhine as lights in the world amongſt them whoſe hearts are ſet on miſchiefe. The Sunne when it ſetteth forth as a Giant to runne his courſe, caſteth forth his beames, and they are diſperſed throughout all places of the earth. And albeit often times it light and ſhine vpon moſt loathſome and filthy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet ſtill doth it remaine in his owne puritie, not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed therewith. Herein theſe lights (I meane the faithfull children of God) muſt reſemble this light of the Sunne. It cannot be that they ſhould not at all conuerſe with wicked and vngodly men, for then they muſt goe out of the world,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith: but herein they muſt be as lights; though they liue amongſt wicked and vngodly men, yet muſt they keepe themſelues vnſtained of the corruptions which are in the world through luſts; though they haue to doe with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and impure men, yet muſt they retaine ſtill within themſelues the puritie of the ſonnes of God. And therefore the Apoſtle in the place before alleadged thus exhorteth, <hi>Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe.</hi> Hee doth not ſimply forbid all fellowſhip with the children of darkneſſe, but with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, ſuch as are gluttonie and drunkenneſſe, chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtrife and enuying, and the like: with the filthineſſe of theſe and the like fruits of ſinne hee would haue vs not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file our ſelues. For <hi>what fellowſhip</hi> (as ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath light with darkneſſe?</hi> Surely no more than hath righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſneſſe, the beleeuer with the Infidell, or Chriſt with Belial. If then we be ſuch lights as here the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children of God are tearmed, no queſtion wee hate all fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe: and if we haue fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, then wee are no ſuch lights. A rule whereby yee may quickly trie
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:599:236"/> and examine whether ye haue that light in your ſelues which yee heare the faithfull children of God ſhould haue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Light where it is, expelleth all darkneſſe. If then yee haue the light of the ſonnes of God within your ſelues, yee haue no delight in the workes of darkneſſe. Now what the workes of darkneſſe are yee know out of the Apoſtle, euen gluttonie and drunkenneſſe, chambering and wantonneſſe, ſtrife and enuying, and generally all the workes of the fleſh, euen whatſoeuer things are ſuch as the doing whereof may not well abide the light. Examine your ſelues of theſe things, and condemne your ſelues, that ye be not condemned of the Lord. If any of you be tainted with any of theſe things, purge out this old leauen, that ye may be a new lumpe; cleanſe your veſſels from theſe filthy dregges, I meane, your ſelues from theſe pollutions of ſinne, that ye may be an holy Temple vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. True it is, God alone is light without any dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and there is no childe of God whoſe light is not dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſome darkneſſe. But this is no ground for thee, that therefore thou maiſt wallow in wickedneſſe and maiſt delight thy ſelfe in the workes of darkneſſe. Thou if thou wilt be the childe of God, thou muſt come as neere vnto God as thou canſt: as hee is light without darkneſſe, ſo thou muſt ſtriue thereunto. And therefore thou muſt ſtriue to abandon all ſinne and wickedneſſe, thou muſt be carefull to walke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly as in the day, thou muſt approue in thine heart, and in thy word, and in thy workes, that which is pleaſing to the Lord. And this if thou doeſt, whatſoeuer is wanting ſhall be imputed vnto thee, and the light that is in Chriſt Ieſus ſhall be thine, and expell whatſoeuer darkneſſe is in thee. Suffer therefore the ſame words of exhortation that the Apoſtle vſeth to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Walke not henceforth as others doe, in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their minde, &amp;c.</hi> And againe with the ſame Apoſtle I ſay vnto you,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The night is paſt, the day is at hand, let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt away the workes of darkneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Haue light in your ſelues, and communicate the light that is in you vnto others: which is the ſecond qualitie mentioned here by the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond qualitie which I noted here in theſe lights, in the <hi>Philippians,</hi> is that they held forth the word of life vnto
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:599:236"/> others. How? Not ſo much in word, and talke, as that by the example of their life they gaue plaine proofe that the word of life dwelt in them plenteouſly. Whence I noted another qualitie neceſſarily requiſite in all the children of God, which is, that they haue not only light in themſelues, but they alſo communicate the ſame vnto others. The children of God muſt not thinke it enough to keepe themſelues vnſpotted of the world, but they muſt by word, and deed, and example of life, helpe to pull others out of the fire. The Prophet deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the wicked man by certaine fruits of the fleſh, amongſt other things ſaith he, <hi>When thou ſaweſt a theefe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50.18.</note> 
                     <hi>thou runneſt with him, and haſt beene partaker with the adulterers.</hi> But the faithfull ſeruant of God muſt not only be no ſuch man as will runne with others vnto miſchiefe, but hee muſt reproue the ſinnes of vnfaithfulneſſe, either by word, or at leaſt by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life, that either by word, or by example of life hee may reclaime the wicked from the wickedneſſe of his wayes. The Sunne (yee know) keepeth not his light vnto it ſelfe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth it to the benefit of all creatures vnder heauen. The Moone and the ſtarres likewiſe, which haue their light from the Sunne, doe the like. The like alſo muſt the ſonnes of God doe. That light which they haue by their fellowſhip with Chriſt Ieſus the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, whether it bee the light of the knowledge of Gods will reuealed in his word, or the light of the ſpirit of ſanctification, all the light that is in them they muſt communicate to the benefit of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, doing good vnto all, and turning many vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. And albeit the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpenſers of Gods holy myſteries, ought eſpecially to be ſuch lights as now wee ſpeake of, holding out the word of life vnto others, and turning many vnto righteouſneſſe, both by word, and by example of life; yet wee ſee that alſo all the faithfull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ought to be ſuch lights, as hauing the word of life in them, ſhew plainly that they haue it, in that the fruit thereof breaketh forth in them, ſometimes in word, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in example of life, vnto the benefit of their brethren. The word of life muſt be hid euen in the hearts of all the ſonnes of God, and it they muſt hold out in holineſſe of life,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:599:237"/> and good example vnto their brethren. Yea, what ſo generall? No exception of country-men, of artificers, of ſimple women, of poore labourers? Muſt all be lights holding forth the word of life? This ſurely is rather for ſcholars, and Miniſters, and learned men, whoſe imployment is in that ſtudie, and who make that their profeſſion. Belike then the Apoſtle was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: for by the Apoſtle it doth plainly appeare, that all the ſonnes of God ſhould be lights holding forth the word of life: ſo that from the word of life hid in their hearts, as from the root, ſhould ſpring all the fruits of that light which they ſhould communicate vnto the benefit of others. True it is, that as one ſtarre differeth from another in glory, ſo amongſt the ſonnes of God, ſome are more cleare and bright ſhining lights than others, ſome better inſtructed and taught in the word of life than others: for ſome are ordained to teach, ſome to be taught; ſome by hearing only, ſome both by hearing and reading, grow vp in the knowledge of the word of life. Yet ſtill this is true, that in all the ſonnes of God there ſhould be ſome meaſure of the knowledge of the word of life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſhould make ſhew at leaſt in holineſſe of their life, and integritie of their conuerſation, whereby they might draw others vnto God. And as it ſhould be, ſo it were to be wiſhed it were. But ſo farre are we from holding out the word of life in holineſſe of life vnto others, that by our prophaneneſſe and wickedneſſe a great many of vs ſhew plainly that the word of life is not in vs. How ready wee are euery one of vs to runne with another vnto miſchiefe, to ſpend the time one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in exceſſe, and riot, and vnthriftineſſe, to deceiue, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, wrong, reuile, and ſhame one another if wee can, hee ſeeth little that ſeeth not. Againe, how ſlow wee are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke one another to godlineſſe and good workes, to draw one another out of the ſnares of the deuill, that wee be not taken and holden therewith, to ſtirre vp one another vnto peace, and loue, and meekneſſe, and temperance, and patience, and almes-deeds, and brotherly kindneſſe, and other ſuch like fruits of the ſpirit, who ſeeth not that ſeeth ought? And if theſe things be ſo, how can wee thinke that the word of life is in vs? Certainly where it is, it maketh the man of God ſo to
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:599:237"/> abound in euery good worke, and ſo to hate euery worke of the fleſh, ſo to ſhine in himſelfe, and likewiſe to giue light vnto others, that it doth eaſily appeare that God is in him indeed. Take heed therefore leſt the light which ſeemeth to be in you be indeed darkneſſe. Haue light in your ſelues, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the light that is in you one with another. Hate the ſins of vnfaithfulneſſe, and the workes of darkneſſe, both in your ſelues, and in others. Prouoke one another to godlineſſe, and to good workes, and hold forth the word of life in all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life one vnto another. Remember that yee are lights; walke therefore as children of the light. It is a title wherein the miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus doe worthily glorie, that they are the lights of the world. Yee ſee that not they alone, but yee alſo are lights of the world, if yee bee the faithfull children of God. Striue herein to bee as neere vnto thy God as thou canſt, that ſo thy light may ſhine, that there bee no darkneſſe at all in thee: and make it a great part of thy ſtudie and delight by the light that is in thee to bring others out of darkneſſe into light. And let this ſuffice to bee ſpoken touching this honor giuen to the ſaints of God, that they are called lights, and touching the qualities required in theſe lights, namely that they haue light in themſelues, and that they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it vnto others.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing which I note in theſe words is the glorious title giuen vnto the word of God. The word of God, and the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt ye ſee is heere caled the word of life. So likewiſe <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it when he ſaith vnto Chriſt, <hi>Maſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh</hi> 6.68.</note> 
                     <hi>to whom ſhall wee goe? Thou haſt the words of eternall life.</hi> So likewiſe the Angell calleth it where hauing brought the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles out of priſon, hee ſaith vnto them, <hi>Goe your way,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 5.20.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſtand in the Temple, and ſpeake to the people all the words of this life.</hi> Now the reaſons why the word of God and the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus is called the word of life, are many: As firſt it is called the word of life, becauſe by it wee are begotten and borne againe vnto a new life, euen a ſpirituall life in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23</note> 
                     <hi>Loue one another with a pure heart feruently, being borne anew, not of mortall ſeede, but of immortall, by the word of God.</hi> Secondly, it is called the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:599:238"/> word of life,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</note> becauſe <hi>it is the power of God vnto ſaluation vnto all them that beleeue, and the ſauour of life vnto life in them that are ſaued,</hi> as witneſſeth the Apoſtle. Thirdly, it is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein Chriſt which is our life, and who is properly called the word of life, is preached and offered vnto vs, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the benefits of his bleſſed death and paſſion. Laſtly it is ſo called, becauſe it is the lanterne vnto our feet, and the light vnto our ſteps, to direct vs in the right way that leadeth to eternall life and ſaluation. Here muſt all other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in the world whatſoeuer ſtand backe. No word of life but this: nay indeed no word but this; for no mans writing whatſoeuer was euer called the word. Only the word of God that is the word, and that is the word of life. I meddle not now with thoſe other glorious titles giuen to the word in holy Scriptures, as that it is called the word of God, the wholeſome word of truth, the Goſpell of ſaluation, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Euen this, that it is called the word of life, may teach vs how precious the miniſterie and preaching thereof ought to be vnto vs, euen more precious than thouſands of gold and ſiluer, and as wee deſire to be ſaued in the day of Chriſt, ſo ſhould wee thirſt after theſe moſt ſweet waters of life. But what thirſting is there after them? They are brought vnto vs in conduits euen vnto our doores, and yet wee will ſcarce ſtep out of our doores to drinke of them: nay wee will ſit in our doores, and in our houſes, talking and ſleeping, rather than wee will come into the houſe of God, and drinke of theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Euery light excuſe and euery ſmall buſineſſe will ſerue to ſtay vs from comming to heare the word read and preached. I told you euen now of our ſlackneſſe in comming, of our negligence in hearing, of our careleſneſſe to meditate after we haue heard of the holy word of life. If I ſhould adde vnto that complaint another of prophaning the Lords day, which ſhould be wholly ſpent in hearing, and reading, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the holy word of life, of prophaning it, I ſay, with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and drinking, and playing at this or that game, or kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping this or that vnprofitable and vnneceſſary obſeruation and cuſtome, ſhould I iuſtly be reproued? Yea but this yee
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:599:238"/> doe in the morning, or in the euening, not in ſeruice-time of day: Yea but this yee doe on the Lords day, which the Lord hath commanded to be kept holy, not only in ſeruice-time of day, but <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou keepe holy the Sabboth day.</hi> Hee doth not limit it to this or that part of the day, but keepe the day holy, by hearing, and reading, and meditating in the holy word of life. Yea but this is too preciſe, and ſtrait, and ſauours too much of Puritaniſme. Well, be it as it will, thou muſt either be a Puritan in obſeruation of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, or elſe thou bringeſt vpon thy ſelfe iudgement. O conſider this, men and brethren, what it is that wee call you vnto. It is the word of life, by which you muſt be begotten vnto eternall life, or elſe you cannot be ſaued, by the direction and guidance whereof you muſt enter into reſt, or elſe you ſhall neuer finde reſt vnto your ſoules. <hi>Dauid</hi> when he could not be preſent in the aſſemblie of Gods people, to praiſe his God, &amp; heare his word, becauſe of his perſecutors, he thought the ſparrowes and the ſwallowes happy, that might neſtle themſelues in the houſe of God. Inſomuch that he brake out, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1.2.84.1.2.3.4 10. Our caſe is not as <hi>Dauids</hi> was: wee may come. We ſhould ſay therefore with <hi>Dauid</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>I was glad, &amp;c.</hi> Yea we ſhould call one vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay as it is in <hi>Eſay, Come and let vs goe vp, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That I may reioyce &amp;c.]</hi> This is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle his latter reaſon whereby he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force his former exhortations: and it is as if he had ſaid; My beloued, I exhort you that you make an end of your owne ſaluation with feare and trembling; and that ye do all things with your neighbours and brethren without murmuring and reaſonings: and theſe things I would haue you to doe as for your owne ſakes, <hi>that yee may be blameleſſe and pure </hi> ſo for my ſake alſo, <hi>that I may reioyce &amp;c.</hi> Yea, and if yee marke it, euen in theſe words he would haue them to doe as he hath exhorted them both for his ſake, and for their ſakes alſo. For he would haue them to walke before God in all obedience with feare and trembling, and with their neighbour in all loue without murmuring &amp;c. why? that he may reioyce: thats for his owne ſake. But wherein doth he deſire to reioyce? Euen in their ſaluation, that he hath not runne in vaine, nor laboured in vaine amongſt them, but that by his Miniſterie and Apoſtleſhip they are gained vnto Chriſt; <hi>That I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the day of Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> By the day of Chriſt the Apoſtle meaneth that day when God ſhall iudge the ſecrets of all men by Ieſus Chriſt; that day of Chriſt his ſecond comming vnto iudgement, when it ſhall be rendred vnto euery man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that he hath done in his fleſh be it good or euill; as alſo in many other places of the new Teſtament. This day is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:599:239"/> ſometimes the day of Gods wrath, ſometimes the day of his appearing, ſometimes the day of iudgement, ſometimes the great day, ſometimes that day, ſometimes the day of the Lord, ſometimes the day of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſometimes the day of Chriſt. Now that day of Chriſt his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto iudgement is therefore called the day of Chriſt, becauſe in that day God ſhall giue all iudgement vnto him, and he ſhall deſcend from heauen with a ſhoute, and with the voice of the Archangell, and with the trumpet of God, and all ſhall appeare before his iudgement ſeate, and he ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſheepe from the goates, and ſet the ſheepe on his right hand, and the goates on the left, and ſhall ſay to the one, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father;</hi> and to the other, <hi>Depart from me yee curſed.</hi> Now the Apoſtle would haue the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſo to walke both before God and men, that in this day of Chriſt when he ſhall giue to euery man according as his worke ſhall be, he may reioyce: wherein? that hee hath not runne in vaine &amp;c, .i. that by his labours he hath gained them vnto Chriſt. The manner of ſpeech which the Apoſtle vſeth, ſeemeth to be borrowed from them that runne in a race, wherein though many runne, and labour hard toward the marke, yet one alone receiueth the price, and the reſt runne in vaine, and labour in vaine, becauſe they obtaine not the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ce or the thing which they runne for. So the Apoſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his account that in reſpect of them he ſhould be like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that runne in vaine and labour in vaine, if hauing la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to gaine them vnto Chriſt, they ſhould not walke worthy of Chriſt. This therefore in this place is the ſumme of the Apoſtle his deſire, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> would ſo walke worthy of Chriſt both before God, and with their brethren, that in the day of Chriſt, when his labours in the Lord ſhould not be in vaine he might reioyce that he had not ſpent his ſtrength amongſt them in vaine, but by his preaching of Chriſt Ieſus vnto them had gained them vnto Chriſt, who ſhould then giue both vnto him and them the crowne of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for their glory. This is the ſumme, and the ſenſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of that which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in this place. Now let vs ſee what vſe we may make hereof for our ſelues.</p>

                  <p>Here then 1. I note that the ſaluation of Gods people is the ioy &amp; crowne of the faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt in the day of Chriſt.

What greater encouragements can there be vnto the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus to make them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and painefull in their places, to make them labour with all alacritie and cheerefulneſſe to gaine many vnto Chriſt, to turne many vnto righteouſneſſe? O but there are many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements: For who more contemned, who more diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who more hated, who more diſgraced then the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus? True it is, and it is the ſhame of our times, that they are counted of many as the very of-ſcourings of the world; and the more faithfull that they are the more they are hated, and oftentimes the more perſecuted. If we ſowe cuſhions vnder all arme-holes; if we ſpeake ſmoothing and fawning words; if we cry peace, peace, all is well; if we med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with the ſinnes of the people, but onely teach a truth in a generalitie, happily we ſhall pleaſe, or not diſpleaſe, but liue in reſt and quiet. But if we lift vp our voices like trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and tell the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> their ſinnes, and the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> their tranſgraſſions; if we ſearch, and cut vp, and lance
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:599:240"/> the ſores of our people; if we ſharply reproue ſuch &amp; ſuch ſins whereof their own conſciences condemne them to be guilty, then they begin to hate vs, to diſgrace vs, to perſecute vs, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs as curſed <hi>Chams,</hi> as ſeditious fellowes, &amp; troublers of the State, and to ſpeake all manner of euill ſayings againſt vs. <hi>Herod,</hi> ye know, <hi>when he heard Iohn did many things,</hi>

For ſinne, God be thanked, may be boldly rebuked without feare of ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But this we finde true by experience, that whoſe ſore we touch his hatred moſt commonly we purchaſe, and if wee be but ſuſpected in our reproofes of ſinne to note ſuch and ſuch men, we ſhall not want whatſoeuer they can ſay or do againſt vs. Thus render they vnto vs hatred for our good will, and when we ſtrike at the roote of any ſinne, and wound only that we may heale; they tell vs we only vtter our choler or malice, and that we might well enough finde our ſelues other matter then to note them in our Sermons. But this, as I ſaid, is the ſhame of our times, that the more faithfull and painefull they are the worſe commonly they are intreated. But herein we comfort our ſelues that our conſcience beareth vs witneſſe in what ſinglenes of heart as before the Lord we doe the worke of our miniſterie, and that howſoeuer now through their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, and reproches, and contempts, and hatreds, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions our reioycing be diminiſhed; yet our reioycing in the day of Chriſt ſhall no man take from vs, but then they that haue beleeued, and they that haue beene conuerted from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtray out of the right way by our miniſterie, ſhall be vnto vs the crowne of our reioycing. Then for that we haue laid out our talent to the beſt aduantage we could, we ſhall heare that voice, <hi>It is well done good ſeruant and faithfull,</hi> and then

In the meane time, if when we haue ſowen the ſeede of Gods word many ſharpe ſhowres doe follow, and many blacke tempeſts ouertake one another, yet muſt we with the husbandman patiently expect the time of harueſt; we muſt in patience poſſeſſe our ſoules vntill the day of Chriſt, and then we ſhall reioyce in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt at his comming, when we and they whom we haue gained vnto Chriſt ſhall meete him in the clouds, that we may be euer with the Lord.

                  <p>Yea but what if when we haue laboured either we ſee no fruits of our labours in them that heare vs, or that fruit which ſeemed to ſhoote forth in the blade doe afterwards fall away and wither,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15</note> as the Apoſtle complaineth that they of <hi>Aſia</hi> were turned from him, doth the glory of the Miniſter in that day depend vpon the ſaluation of them that heare him? Doth he runne in vaine, and labour in vaine, if he gaine not them vnto Chriſt? Certainly of this I am perſwaded that the moe ſoules they gaine vnto Chriſt, the more glorious ſhall be their crowne of reioycing. And therefore the Apoſtles glory, no doubt ſhall be exceeding glorious, by whoſe labours ſo many Churches were planted, ſo many ſoules were brought vnto the faith. Yet his glory in that day doth not wholy depend vpon the ſaluation of them that heare him. The vſing of his talent faithfully ſhall be accounted vnto him as gaining with it. Neither is his running and his labouring in vaine in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelfe, but onely in reſpect of them whoſe hearts the Lord doth not open that they ſhould heare, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and be ſaued: as it is plaine out of <hi>Eſay,</hi> where Chriſt in his members thus complaineth, <hi>I haue laboured in vaine, I haue ſpent my ſtrength in vaine,</hi>

                     <hi>yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength.</hi> By which words it is out of all doubt cleared, that howſoeuer the Miniſters labour be often

Though they that heare them be of ſuch vncircumciſed hearts and eares that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gained vnto Chriſt, yet ſhall they be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and their God ſhall be their ſtrength. To the like purpoſe is that in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> where the Lord inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Miniſter, and watchman of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his dutie, he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>EZec.</hi> 3.17.19.21</note> 
                     <hi>Sonne of man I haue made thee a watchman &amp;c. if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor from his wicked way, he ſhall die in his iniquitie, but thou haſt deliuered thy ſoule &amp;c.</hi> What is then the Miniſters dutie? To warne the wicked: and his dutie is to turne from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of his waies. If the Miniſter warne, his labour is not in vaine in the Lord, he deliuereth his owne ſoule: but if the wicked being warned turne not from the wickedneſſe of his waies, he dieth in his iniquitie; ſo that his Miniſter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of him hath runne in vaine, and laboured in vaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not reclaimed him from the wickedneſſe of his wayes.</p>
                  <p>Here then is a notable aduertiſement for them that are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the word, to take heede that their watchman which is ſet ouer them ſpend not his ſtrength in vaine, and for nothing amongſt them. The Miniſter, yee heare, he runnes, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, he ſweates, he is ſtill playing his prizes, ſtill trying his maiſteries, ſtill plowing vp the fallow ground of your hearts, in euery ſeaſon, yea in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon ſowing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeede of the word, alwaies on his watch tower in cold and in heate, giuing warning of euery enemie which he doth deſcry. Happily yee haue another conceit of the Miniſters labour, at leaſt many haue, that it is no ſuch continuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that there is no ſuch care or paines therein as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Well whatſoeuer account yee make of the labour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſpends his ſtrength, and oftentimes his bloud. It is for you to looke vnto it that he ſpend not his ſtrength in vaine. If he teach you the waies of the Lord, and yee receiue not
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:599:242"/> inſtruction, if he reproue ſuch ſinnes as breake out amongſt you, and ye hate to be reformed, if hee call to faſting, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and mourning, and ye fall to eating, drinking, and dauncing; if he exhort you to ſtudy to bee blameleſſe, and pure, and the ſonnes of God in the middeſt of a naughty and crooked nation, and to ſhine amongſt them as lights, holding forth the word of life, and ye giue your members ſeruants to vncleaneſſe, and to iniquity, to commit iniquity; in a word, if he out of the word either teach, or improue, or correct, or inſtruct in righteouſneſſe, &amp; ye refuſe to hearken to the voice of the charmer charme he neuer ſo wiſely, what elſe doth hee in reſpect of you but runne in vaine, and labour in vaine? And if he ſpend his ſtrength in vaine amongſt you, his worke is with his God; but your bloud is vpon your owne head, yee die in your ſinnes, but his ſoule is deliuered. The miniſter his deſire is to reioyce in the day of Chriſt, but wherein? in your ſaluation. If in that day he ſhall not reioyce in your ſaluation, what do ye thinke will be your portion? His deſire is not to runne in vaine, nor to labour in vaine: but it is in reſpect of you, that he may gaine you vnto Chriſt. For hee knoweth that his labour is not in vaine in the Lord. Hearken therefore and obey, and harden not your hearts as in the prouocation, and as in the day of tentation in the wilderneſſe. If thou hearken, thou ſhalt be the crowne of his reioycing, and the crowne of his reioycing is in thy ſaluation. And in any caſe take heed that thou iudge not amiſſe of him that is ſet ouer thee in the Lord, to admoniſh thee of thy w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is wherein he either teacheth, or improueth, or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, or inſtructeth thee it is that hee may reioyce in the day of Chriſt, that he hath not runne in vaine, nor laboured in vaine. And this much of this later reaſon to enforce the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exhortations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea and though I be offered &amp;c.]</hi> The Apoſtle as yee haue heard vrged the <hi>Philippians</hi> that they would walke in all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with God, and in all meekneſſe with their brethren, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the rather for his ſake that he might reioyce ouer them in the day of Chriſt. Now the better to enforce this reaſon drawne from himſelfe, in theſe words hee aſſureth them that
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:599:242"/> ſuch is his longing after their ſaluation, that if by his death they might be confirmed and ſtrengthened in the faith, hee would moſt willingly and ioyfully giue his life for them, and if he ſhall do ſo, he would not haue them to be ſory, but to be glad and reioyce thereat. The manner of ſpeech here vſed is drawne from the ſacrifices of the old law, wherein the Prieſts were commanded after their comming into the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 15 7</note> alwaies to poure out a drinke offering vpon the ſacrifice that was offered. The Apoſtle therefore alluding hereunto ſaith, that if his ſoule ſhould now bee poured out as a drinke offering vpon that ſpirituall ſacrifice of their faith, which by his miniſtery and Apoſtleſhip they had embraced for their farther confirmation and ſtrengthening therein, he would be glad, and reioyce with them for that their faith by his death were ſtrengthened.</p>
                  <p>Here then we may obſerue how zealous the Paſtor ought to be of the ſaluation of his flocke, he ought with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this place to be willing to giue vp his life for them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11.</note> 
                     <hi>The good ſhepheard,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>giueth his life for his ſheepe.</hi> Chriſt himſelfe was indeed this good ſhepheard here ſpoken of, who when wee were yet ſinners died for vs. But herein likewiſe he ſet before vs a paterne, how we ſhould approue our ſelues to be good ſhepheards. Nothing ſhould bee ſo deare vnto vs as the good of them ouer whom the Lord made vs ouerſeers, perſecution and baniſhment, ſtripes and impriſonments, yea the loſſe of life it ſelfe muſt rather bee indured then their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation be neglected. What then? are wee ſimply to giue vp our liues for our flockes: What if they be ſuch as will bee glad thereat, and rather then faile will themſelues perſecute vs, yea and take our liues from vs? Such ſheepe indeed there are as perſecute their ſhepheard, and deſire if they can to make him wearie of his life. But this is that which now from our Apoſtle we teach, that if our death may bee for the enlarging of Chriſt his kingdome, and for the confirmation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their faith vnto whom we haue preached the Goſpell, then we are not to loue our liues vnto the death. What then? becauſe our death may be for the confirmation of their faith, are we to offer our ſelues vnto death? Nay wee may not ſeeke
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:599:243"/> death, nor willingly runne our ſelues into danger. But if the will of the Lord be ſuch that by our bloud wee ſeale that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which we haue giuen to Chriſt Ieſus, and ſo confirme our brethren in the things that they haue heard and learned by our miniſtery, we are not to ſhrinke at it, but willingly to embrace it. Yea but the cuppe of death is bitter, how then can we be glad and reioyce in it. True, happily we ſhould not greatly reioyce in that violent and vntimely death being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelfe. But knowing that our bloud is the ſeede of the Church, and that by our death and perſecution many are made more bold to profeſſe the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, wee ſhould be glad and reioyce in the fruit that we know comes to the Church by our death and perſecution. And thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour by precept hath taught vs to doe ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are yee when men reuile you, and perſecute you &amp;c. reioyce and bee glad, for great is your reward in heauen.</hi> Thus the Apoſtles likewiſe haue taught vs by example, who when they had bin caſt in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and afterwards beaten, departed reioycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer rebuke for Chriſt his name. As they by precept and example haue taught vs, ſo ought wee to reioyce in tribulations and perſecutions, &amp; to be glad though we be offered vp vpon the ſacrifice of their faith who by our miniſterie haue belieued.</p>
                  <p>Should then the ſaluation of your ſoules, and the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of your faith be ſo deare vnto vs, euen dearer then our owne liues? How ought ye then to be affected towards vs, and our miniſterie? It was a notable teſtimonie that the Apoſtle gaue vnto the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15.</note> wherein he bore them record that if it had beene poſſible they would haue pluckt out their owne eies, and haue giuen them to him. Nothing more deare then their eyes, and yet ſo neere had their ſoules beene knit vnto him in reuerence and loue for the Goſpells ſake, that they would haue giuen him their very eies to haue done him good. Shall I ſay that ye ought to be thus affected towards vs? I ſay not ſo: but I ſay that ye ought ſo to thinke of vs, as of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, and diſpoſers of the ſecrets of God. Yee ought to thinke of vs as of the Embaſſadors for Chriſt, and that we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, as though God did beſeech
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:599:243"/> you through vs. In a word, if we ought to lay downe our liues for our ſheepe, our ſheepe ought to heare our voice. And certainely if we were ſo liuely and Chriſtianly toucht with a feeling of the ſweetneſſe of the word of life as we ſhould be, if the powerfulneſſe thereof had ſo ſeaſoned and ſeazed vpon our ſoules as it ought, then would we heare his voice, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, and follow him, we would reuerence and regard him for the truths ſake which he preacheth. It is ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that when ſhe had heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach, and the Lord had ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened her hart that ſhe belieued the things that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpak, ſhe was ſo deſirous that <hi>Paul</hi> and thoſe that were with him ſhould come into her houſe, and abide a while with her, that ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer left them till ſhe had conſtrained them;<note place="margin">

Not many <hi>Lydiaes.</hi> I wiſh we might haue ſuch hearers, as <hi>Peter</hi> had, that when they had heard vs would be pricked in their hearts, and ſay vnto vs, <hi>men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi>

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37.</note> ſuch as would be ſo carefull to heare what we ſpeake that they would lay the ſame vp in their hearts, and digeſt it in their ſoules. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is as I ſaid ere while, that our labour in the word may not be vnto you in vaine, but that by our miniſtery we may offer you vp as liuing ſacrifices, holy, and acceptable vnto God. If we ought not to ſpare our liues vnto the death for you, yee ought ſo to heare the word of vs that yee grow vp in faith, and loue, and euery good worke. If wee ought to poure out our bloud for an offering for you, for the confirming of your faith, ye ought firſt by faith through our miniſtery to be made a ſpirituall ſacrifice vnto God, that ſo our ſoules may be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out as a drinke offering vpon the ſacrifice of your faith. For both theſe are implied here in our Apoſtle. Wee heare what Paſtor and people ſhould doe: and wee ſee in daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience what they doe, euen both ſo little anſwerably vnto that they ſhould doe, that it may be as truly now ſaid, as it was in the Prophets time, like Paſtor, like people. But I will not now ſtand farther to open and cut vp theſe ſoares. Conſider

                     </gap>hinkes may be gathered from theſe words for the ſtirring vp of both Paſtor and people vnto that they ſhould doe.</p>
                  <p>If ye marke it, both the obedience of their faith which are gained vnto Chriſt by the miniſterie of the word, and likwiſe the martyrdome and death of thoſe that giue their liues for their ſheepe, are by a borrowed ſpeech called ſacrifices and offerings. Though I be offered, there the Apoſtle his death is called an offering: vpon the ſacrifice and ſeruice of your faith, their faith, whereunto by his ſeruice and miniſtery they had obeyed, is called a ſacrifice. Now what ſacrifices be theſe? Theſe be the ſacrifices of the new Teſtament: theſe bee liuely ſacrifices and holy, and acceptable vnto God: and theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſacrifice of praiſe, and of the workes of loue are the only ſacrifices which now Chriſtians are to offer vnto their God. An end of all other ſacrifices was then when Chriſt cried vpon the croſſe, <hi>it is finiſhed.</hi> Theſe onely remaine, and theſe are our reaſonable ſeruing of God. How ſhould not this ſtirre vp both Paſtor and people to doe that they ſhould? In the Paſtor his burning zeale to giue his life for his people, in the people their obedience of faith by the miniſtery of their Paſtors, are their holy and Chriſtian ſacrifices, and their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſeruing of God. And theſe ſacrifices are now no leſſe to be offered by vs in the new Teſtament, then were thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of beaſts and other like things to be offered in the old Teſtament, and ſurely are farre more acceptable vnto God then were they. But I promiſed only to ſpeak of this in a word. Now a word likewiſe of that that followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the ſame cauſe &amp;c.]</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle armeth them againſt ſorrow if he ſhould be offered vp vpon the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of their faith. As he would be glad and reioyce with them if their faith ſhould be confirmed by his death, ſo hee would haue them likewiſe to be glad and reioyce with him if hee by his bloud ſhould ſeale the teſtimony of their faith. What then? muſt we be glad and reioyce when our beſt Paſtors and teachers are taken from vs? Did not the Church well, when <hi>Steuen</hi> was ſtoned to death,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 8.2.</note> to make great lamentation for him? Yes no doubt they did well: and whenſoeuer the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:599:244"/> Church is depriued of any worthy member, eſpecially of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy Paſtor and Teacher, there is iuſt cauſe of great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And the Apoſtle alloweth a moderation in lamenting for the dead, <hi>ſo that we ſorrow not as they that haue no hope.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13.</note> And it was a part of <hi>Iehoiakims</hi> plague that he ſhould be buried like an Aſſe, and none to make lamentation for him. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then is not, that we ſhould reioyce and be glad, and not mourne ſimply at the death of our beſt Paſtors and Teachers, but that wee ſhould bee glad and reioyce at the fruite which comes to the Church by their death, if they ſuffer martyrdom for the confirmation of the brethrens faith. For ſeeing their conſtancie and their cheerefulneſſe to ſeale that truth with their bloud which they taught and preached, this ſhould both make vs reioice that God giueth ſuch ſtrength vnto his Saints, and likewiſe confirme vs in the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther animate vs patiently to endure whatſoeuer tribulations for Chriſt his ſake. The Apoſtle himſelfe would not, no doubt, reioyce ſimply in his ſuffering and death, but in that onely thereby God ſhould be glorified, and Gods children ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened. So we are to reioyce not ſimply that our Paſtors and Teachers are taken by the hands of Tyrants, and racked, and martyred, but in that God vouchſafeth thus to conforme them to the image of his ſonne, and to make their bloud the ſeede of the Church, ſo that thereby both the faith of them that are already in the Church is confirmed, and others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are brought vnto the faith. Here only wee are to looke to this caueat, that we do not iudge of a martyr only by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but further by the cauſe of his ſuffering. For not the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but the cauſe of his ſuffering makes him a Martyr. If he ſuffer death for the teſtimonie of Chriſt Ieſus his death is well called a martyrdome. And in his death we are ſo to reioyce as already ye haue heard. Thus farre of the reaſons enforcing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to thoſe exhortations which the Apoſtle inferreth vpon the example of Chriſt his humility and obedience, which the Apoſtle laid as a moſt ſtrong and ſure ground of his exhortation vnto humbleneſſe and lowlines of minde.</p>

To comfort them therefore he 1. promiſeth to ſend <hi>Timothy</hi> vnto them, a man whom themſelues knew to bee a faithfull miniſter of Chriſt Ieſus, and to loue them ſincerely. 2. He putteth them in hope of his owne comming ſhortly after vnto them. 3. He telleth them that now he ſendeth their faithfull miniſter <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> vnto them, and the cauſes why. By all which things as the <hi>Philippians</hi> were iuſtly to be comforted, ſo were they ſo many caueats to warne them that neither <hi>Timothy,</hi> nor hee, nor <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> might finde any cauſe of griefe, or diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort amongſt them when they ſhould come vnto them. In his promiſe to ſend <hi>Timothy</hi> vnto them, I note, 1. his promiſe to ſend him; 2. the reaſon why he ſent him rather then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In his promiſe 1.

                  <p>Touching the 1. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not abſolutely promiſe to ſend <hi>Timothy</hi> vnto them, but, ſaith he, <hi>I hope in the Lord Ieſus &amp;c.</hi> It is to bee vnderſtood that at this time when the Apoſtle wrote theſe things, he was in priſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Timothy</hi>

Now it ſeemes he was in hope ſhortly to bee deliuered out of priſon, and then his certaine reſolution was firſt to ſend <hi>Timothy</hi> vnto them, and then ſhortly after himſelfe to come vnto them. But how the Lord would diſpoſe of theſe things he knew not. Onely hee knew that the heart of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> who had caſt him in priſon was in the hand of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to diſpoſe of as ſeemed beſt to his godly wiſedome, and ſo he loued them that he hoped the Lord Ieſus would deliuer him out of priſon, and bring him vnto them. Becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew not certainely how it would pleaſe the Lord to diſpoſe of theſe things, hee doth not abſolutely promiſe to ſend <hi>Timothy</hi> vnto them, but inaſmuch as his loue to them made him to hope the beſt, hee ſaith, <hi>I hope in the Lord Ieſus &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The leſſon which hence wee haue to learne is this, in all things whatſoeuer we purpoſe to doe ſtill to depend vpon the will and pleaſure of the Lord Ieſus; not reſolutely to ſet down this or that will I doe, but with theſe or the like conditions and limitations, I hope in the Lord Ieſus to doe it, if God will I will doe it &amp;c. For as in God alone we liue, and mooue, and haue our being, ſo he alone directeth all our waies, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all our counſels as ſeemeth beſt vnto his godly wiſedome. We may purpoſe, and we may intend ſuch and ſuch things as come into our heads, or our occaſions lead vs vnto, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lies it in vs to bring the things to paſſe, neither doe wee know what ſhall be the euent of ſuch things as wee purpoſe. It is God that by his ſpeciall prouidence doth direct the euent of whatſoeuer we purpoſe euen as it beſt pleaſeth him. This is plaine by diuers places of ſcripture which might be alledged to this purpoſe. The hart of man purpoſeth his way,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.9.</note> ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> but the Lord directeth his ſteps. His ſteps. What is that? euen all mens actions &amp; whatſoeuer he taketh in hand are gouern'd by God, and directed as ſeemeth beſt vnto him. Again, it is an other prouerbe of <hi>Salomon;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:599:246"/> that he cannot poſſibly vnderſtand certainely the iſſues of his owne thoughts and purpoſes. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> thus confeſſeth vnto the Lord and ſaith, <hi>O Lord I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>neither is it in man to walke and direct his ſteps.</hi> Which the Prophet ſpake vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> turning his power to goe againſt <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> becauſe of <hi>Zedekiaes</hi> rebellion; when at his firſt ſetting forth from home he had purpoſed to haue made warre againſt the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites.</hi> Such is the power of the Lord to turne the purpoſes and deuiſes of mans heart which way it ſeemeth beſt vnto him, ſo that whatſoeuer his purpoſe be, yet can he not tell what ſhall be the iſſue thereof. Nay if we looke a litle farther into the matter we ſhall finde, that howſoeuer it ſeemeth vnto man that it is in himſelfe to purpoſe and deuiſe what himſelfe liſteth, yet can he not deuiſe or purpoſe any thing that is good, vnleſſe God by his grace preuenting him put them in his heart; according to that it is ſaid, <hi>It is God which worketh in vs both the will, and the deede, euen of his good pleaſure.</hi> And therefore that place mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>The heart of man purpoſeth his way;</hi> and that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſame chapter, <hi>The preparations of the heart are in man &amp;c,</hi> they are to be vnderſtood onely by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, as if <hi>Salomon</hi> had thus ſaid; Be it that man hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable thoughts in his heart, be it that in his head he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe this and that, as if it were in himſelfe to purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe what he would, which is not, <hi>yet the anſwer of the tongue is of the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi> The meaning of the whole indeed is this, that both the thoughts of mans heart, and the words of mans mouth are wholy guided and gouerned by the Lord. Not onely then the ſucceſſe and euent of whatſoeuer we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but both the purpoſes of our hearts, by grace preuenting vs, and likewiſe the iſſues thereof by grace following vs are wholly gouerned of the Lord. He in his ſpeciall prouidence ordereth and diſpoſeth all things as ſeemeth beſt vnto him. We are therefore to learne wholly to depend vpon him in whoſe hand are our hearts and all our waies; and whatſoeuer it be that we purpoſe to do, we are not reſolutely to ſet downe this or that will I doe, as if our owne waies were in our owne
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:599:246"/> hands, but ſtill with ſubmiſſion vnto the Lord, I hope in the Lord Ieſus, and, if the Lord will. It was the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> his complaint, that men too much preſuming of themſelues would ſet downe and ſay,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.13.</note> 
                     <hi>We will goe to day or to morrow into ſuch a Citie, or ſuch a Citie, we will continue there ſo long and ſo long, we will buy and ſell ſuch and ſuch wares, and we will make ſuch and ſuch gaine.</hi> And I wiſh it might not iuſtly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of at this day, that we doe too too reſolutely breake out into ſuch ſpeeches as theſe mentioned by the Apoſtle, and other ſuch like. Well, that which the Apoſtle laid downe for a rule vnto them, ought alſo to be a rule vnto vs: we ought to ſay in all ſuch caſes, <hi>if the Lord will</hi> we will doe this or that: or as our Apoſtle ſaith in this place, <hi>I hope in the Lord Ieſus</hi> to doe this or that. This forme of ſpeech beſt beſeemeth Chriſtians, and vſing this forme of ſpeech we ſhew plainely whatſoeuer it is we goe about, or purpoſe to doe, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholy vpon the Lord his pleaſure for the ſucceſſe and iſſue thereof, and acknowledge that onely what he will ſhall be done therein. Howbeit I doe not vrge this forme of ſpeech as ſo preciſely neceſſarie that I put any religion therein, or condemne the omitting thereof as prophane and wicked. For I know that many godly men who gladly acknowledge that truth which I haue taught, and likewiſe that many of the ſaints and ſeruants of God euen in the holy ſcriptures haue not vſed this forme of ſpeech alwaies vpon ſuch occaſions. Yet could I wiſh, and would exhort euen all the children of God vpon all ſuch occaſions euen preciſely to obſerue this forme of ſpeech: and that with ſuch reuerence and holy feare, as that thereby they would plainely ſhew that indeede they doe not forget themſelues, but know that it is the Lord that ordereth them and all their waies euen as it beſt pleaſeth him, and what ſucceſſe he giueth to their purpoſes that they ſhall haue, whether it be to proſper them, or to ouerthrow them. I adde this of obſeruing this forme of ſpeech with reuerence and holy feare, becauſe it ſo falleth out, I know not how, that oftentimes we vſe good formes of ſpeach, when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our thoughts are litle ſet, at leaſt not ſo reuerently as they ought, vpon that we ſay. For example, what more
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:599:247"/> common then when we haue ſworne to ſay, God forgiue me that I ſweare; when wee haue done ſuch an euill thing, to ſay, God I cry thee mercy what meant I to doe that; and in this that we now ſpeake of, when we meane to do ſuch a thing to ſay, Ile doe it, and God will. Speeches commonly vſed, and oftentimes, I doubt not, very well vſed; but oftentimes in ſuch an idle and onely cuſtomarie maner that therein we greatly offend, becauſe thinking not what we ſpeake, we ſpeake not with that reuerence we ought to ſpeake. And indeede it is a plaine breach of the third commandement, wherein we are forbidden to take the name of the Lord in vaine: for ſo often is this holy name taken in vaine, as it is vſed without great reuerence and feare. To conclude this point therefore, let vs learne in all things whatſoeuer we doe, or purpoſe to doe, ſtill to depend vpon the will and pleaſure of the Lord; let vs by the very forme of ſpeech which we vſe ſhew that we doe ſo, ſaying with our Apoſtle, <hi>I hope in the Lord Ieſus to doe ſuch a thing;</hi> or with <hi>Iames, If God will and giue leaue I will doe ſuch a thing;</hi> and theſe words let vs vſe with all reuerence and holy feare, as ſpeaking from our heart that which proceedeth out of our lips. Thus much of the limitation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. The promiſe followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To ſend Timotheus ſhortly vnto you]</hi> This was the Apoſtle his promiſe to ſend <hi>Timothie</hi> vnto them. Who <hi>Timotheus</hi> was appeareth out of <hi>Act.</hi> 16.1. His mother a Ieweſſe, his father a Graecian, a man famouſly knowne and much renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by reaſon of thoſe two Epiſtles which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote vnto him; whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes calleth his companion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a miniſter of God, ſometimes his brother and fellow-helper in the Goſpell of Chriſt, ſometimes his beloued ſonne, ſometimes his naturall ſonne in the faith. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing that the <hi>Philippians</hi> liued in the middeſt of a naughty and crooked nation, and being aduertiſed by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> their Miniſter that they were troubled with certaine falſe Apoſtles which gloried in their Circumciſion, promiſeth for their comfort to ſend <hi>Timothie</hi> vnto them.</p>
                  <p>And this commendeth vnto vs the godly care that ought to be in the Miniſter of Ieſus Chriſt toward his people to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:599:247"/> them in all their diſtreſſes. The ſame care that <hi>Paul</hi> had to comfort them by ſending a faithfull Miniſter vnto them, the ſame ought now the Miniſter of Chriſt to haue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his people by the miniſterie of the word. We are not now to ſend others: we haue now our ſtandings appointed vnto vs, and therein we are to labour to be ſuch comfort vnto our people by the miniſterie of the word, as <hi>Paul</hi> purpoſed that <hi>Timothie</hi> ſhould be vnto them. Yet how it falls out I know not, but ſo it is, though we be neither Apoſtles, but tyed vnto our ſeuerall charges, nor lye in priſon that we cannot come our ſelues, but liue at eaſe in other places following our owne pleaſures, yet will we, as <hi>Paul</hi> here did vnto them, ſend vnto our people, not <hi>Timotheus,</hi> but ſuch as are not at all able to miniſter a word in due ſeaſon. But I onely touch this, this place of ſcripture as mee thinks, vrging mee therevnto, the enlarging of the point being more fit for other places then this.</p>
                  <p>The end wherefore he ſent <hi>Timothie</hi> vnto them was, as here he ſaith, that he might be comforted when he knew their eſtate. In that he ſaith, <hi>that I alſo may be of good comfort,</hi> this doth plainely ſhew that which I noted before in the promiſe, that the Apoſtle meant to ſend <hi>Timothie</hi> vnto them that they might be comforted by his miniſterie. For ſo he ſaith, <hi>I trust &amp;c. to ſend &amp;c.</hi> that I alſo may be of good comfort, .i. that as you ſhall be comforted by his comming to you and his miniſterie among you, ſo I likewiſe may be comforted when at his returning from you he ſhall tell me your ſtate, that you ſtand in the faith, and in the fellowſhip which yee haue with other Churches in the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>Here then we may obſerue a note of true Chriſtianitie, and ſincere loue, which is to be ſo mutually carefull one for an other that we reioyce one in anothers good, and that we be ſorry one at anothers miſery. A thing whereunto if either precept, or example, or nature may ſtirre vs vp we cannot want encitements thereunto.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Reioyce</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe.</hi> Where (yee ſee) the Apoſtle his rule and precept is, that we be ſo mutually affectioned one vnto another, that the ioy of one may be the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:599:248"/> ioy of another, and the griefe of one may be the griefe of another, being ſo knit together with the bond of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that both we reioyce, and likewiſe weepe together. Now ſee the practiſe of this rule in the Apoſtle himſelfe: For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching reioycing, doth he not in the beginning of all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles almoſt teſtifie his comfort and reioycing in all thoſe Churches for that they continued in the faith, and reioyced in the Goſpell of Chriſt? How often doth he begin his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with this and the like ſaying, <hi>I thanke my God alwaies on your behalfe for the grace of God which is giuen you in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus &amp;c?</hi> All his Epiſtles to the Churches, ſaue that to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> haue this or the like beginning. Whereby he ſignifieth his reioycing in their ioy in the Holy Ghoſt. Likewiſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weeping and ſorrowing at the griefes of others, he ſaith, <hi>Who is weake,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</note> 
                     <hi>and I am not weake; who is offended, and I burne not?</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid, ſuch is my care of all the Churches, and ſo is my ſoule knit vnto them, that the things that happen vnto them I count to happen vnto my ſelfe; ſo that as their ioy is my ioy, ſo their weakneſſe is my weakneſſe, their ſcandall is my ſcandall, and their griefe is my griefe. What ſhould I bring other examples to this purpoſe? Doth not euen nature teach this mutuall care one of another, and this mutuall affection one towards another? In the members of our bodie,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26.</note> if one member ſuffer, doe not all the members ſuffer with it, and if one member be had in honor, do not all the members reioyce with it? Let but the toe be pricked, head and hands, and all bowe downe to it to helpe it, and are grieued with it. Let the hungry belly be ſatisfied, all the reſt of the members are refreſhed and cheared therewithall. And as it is in the members of the naturall bodie, ſo ſhould it be in the members of the myſticall bodie. All we (my brethren) are baptized by one ſpirit into one bodie. We are all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt Ieſus, and euery one anothers members, if we be indeede the ſonnes of God. We ſhould therefore be ſo affectioned one towards another, as both the precept of the Apoſtle, and the example of the Apoſtle, both here, and often elſe where, and as nature it ſelfe doth teach vs. We ſhould be ſo mutually carefull one of another, that we ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:599:248"/> one in anothers comfort, and grieued one in anothers griefe. Our ioy ſhould be the ioy one of another, our ſorrow ſhould be the ſorrow one of another, and our affections ſhould be mutuall one towards another. But looke generally into the Church, doe we take comfort in the ſtate of ſuch Churches as we ought to be comforted in? and againe are we grieued for the ſtate of other Churches which we ought to be grieued for? Nay I feare me that the ſtate of ſuch Churches as ſhould comfort vs doth grieue vs, and that we are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the ſtate of other Churches which ſhould grieue vs. Looke particularly into our ſelues, is it a comfort vnto vs when we know of the good ſtate one of another; and is it a griefe vnto vs when we heare of the decaied ſtate one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? Nay commonly we repine when we ſee the ſtate of others better then our owne either in wealth, or in honor, or in fauour, or the like: and commonly we are glad when we ſee another, eſpecially if he be of the ſame trade and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with vs, goe downe the winde, as we ſay. We ioy not one in the ioy of another, we grieue not one in the griefe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: but contrariwiſe we rather ioy one in the griefe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and grieue one in the ioy of another. Well, ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, and ſuch grieuing are not good. Let vs, euen ſo many as feare God, be otherwiſe affected one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Let vs take comfort in the good one of another, in the growing vp in wealth, in honor, in fauour, in knowledge, in wiſdome, and in euery good grace of the ſpirit one of another; and let vs be grieued in the miſery, in the penurie, in the trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, in the ſorrow, in the ignorance, in the badnes one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And if we ſhall doe this, ſo many precepts of loue and charitie ſhall not be needfull for vs, but by the fruits of an vnfeigned loue we ſhall ſhew our ſelues to be Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: for this is an vndoubted note of true Chriſtianitie, and of ſincere loue ſo mutually to be carefull one for another, that we reioyce one in anothers good, and be ſorry one at anothers griefe or miſerie. Now followeth the reaſon why he ſent him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For I haue no man like minded &amp;c.]</hi> This is the reaſon why he rather ſendeth <hi>Timothie</hi> then any of the reſt that were with
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:599:249"/> him, becauſe of all that were with him none were like minded in generall to doe their dutie in their miniſterie, and none which in particular would ſo faithfully and ſincerely care for their matters, and for the good of their Church as would he. A great commendation of <hi>Timothie</hi> which was ſent, great loue in the Apoſtle to ſend ſuch a man vnto them, and very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull for them to receiue ſuch a man ſent in ſuch loue with all gladnes, and to make much of ſuch: all points very well worthy a large diſcourſe; but I can onely point at them. The commendation of <hi>Timothie</hi> a very fit patterne of a man meete to be commended to the worke of the miniſterie, and to be placed ouer a Congregation, to ſerue in the Tabernacle. He ſhould be ſuch a one as in generall hath a prompt and ready minde to doe the worke of the Lord, to labour in the Lord his vineyard, to doe the worke of an Euangeliſt, and of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; and ſuch a one as in particular hath an earneſt deſire to procure their good vnto whom he is ſent, and will faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diligently labour to preſent them ouer whom he is ſet pure and vnblameable before God. For firſt his very office, which is to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, ſhould worke in him a loue and cheerefull minde to teach the Lord his will, and to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. Otherwiſe he is not meete to be commended to the worke of the miniſterie; or at leaſt not ſo meete as thoſe that haue a prompt minde to doe the worke of the Lord. And againe, his loue of that people vnto which he is ſent ſhould make him faithfully to labour to gaine them vnto Chriſt, that they may be his crowne and his ioy in that day. Otherwiſe he is not meete to be ſet ouer that people, or at leaſt not ſo meete as they that would faithfully labour to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the Apoſtle his care to ſend ſuch a man vnto them, may be a good patterne to Biſhops and Patrons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, what manner of men to commend vnto the worke of the miniſterie, and to commit the charge of ſoules vnto. In the like care and loue of Gods people, they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſuch men to this worke, and this charge, as we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken of, men willing to doe the worke of the Lord, and which will faithfully care for their matters ouer whom
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:599:249"/> they are ſet. Otherwiſe to ſay the leaſt, they ſhew themſelues not to haue that care and loue of Gods people which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had of theſe <hi>Philippians:</hi> whereas their care ſhould be the greater, becauſe they commend vnto a continuall charge, and <hi>Paul</hi> onely ſent <hi>Timothie</hi> to continue for a ſeaſon with the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians.</hi> But the ſpeaking of theſe things in this place is to litle purpoſe; therefore I briefly paſſe them ouer.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which I obſerued in theſe words, was, how behoouefull it was for the <hi>Philippians</hi> to receiue ſuch a man, ſent in ſuch loue, with all gladneſſe, and to make of ſuch: for therefore (no doubt) did the Apoſtle the rather commend him ſo as hath beene ſaid, that ſo the rather they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him, and embrace his doctrine the more gladly, and be the more careful that he might not miſlike any thing amongſt them when he ſhould come amongſt them. And this may teach you in what reuerence you ought to haue ſuch men when they are ſet ouer you in the Lord, euen for the words ſake which they preach vnto you. They faithfully care for your matters, not for your worldly matters, either in reſpect of you, or of themſelues; for they ſeeke not yours, but you: but they faithfully care for your ſpirituall matters, euen for the ſaluation of your ſoules; in Chriſt his ſtead they beſeech you, and exhort you vnto the things that belong vnto your peace; they teach, they improue, they correct, they inſtruct you, and all is, that your ſoules may be ſaued in the day of Chriſt. Now they leade you forth beſides the waters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, now they bring you to feed in greene paſtures, now they call you backe when yee are wandring out of the way, now they leade you on along in the way, now they wound and breake the hairie ſcalpe of him that goeth on in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, now they heale the bruiſed and afflicted ſoule, groning vnder the weight and burden of his ſinne. Theſe are ſuch of your matters as they care for, and theſe they faithfully care for, if they be faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus. In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard doe yee thinke yee ought then to haue them euen for their workes ſake? <hi>Obey them that haue the ouerſight of you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and ſubmit your ſelues vnto them, for they watch for your ſoules, as they that muſt giue accounts, that they
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:599:250"/> may doe it with ioy, and not with griefe.</hi> And in another place: <hi>Wee beſeech you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Th.</hi> 5.12.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that yee know them which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour amongst you, and are ouer you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, that yee haue them in ſingular loue for their workes ſake.</hi> By both which places yee ſee what reuerence is to be giuen vnto the faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus. Now, as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Saul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 15.22</note> 
                     <hi>Hath the Lord as great pleaſure in burnt offerings and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as when his voice is obeyed?</hi> ſo I ſay vnto you, Haue we as great pleaſure in any outward reuerence that can be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our perſons, as when the word of the Lord which wee preach vnto you is obeyed? No, my brethren, thats not the thing which wee vrge, albeit that alſo is by you to be regarded, but the principall marke which wee ſhoot at, is, that wee may not runne in vaine, nor labour in vaine amongſt you, but that wee may bring you to the obedience of the faith. We would haue you to take heed vnto the wholeſome word of truth, which is able to make you wiſe vnto ſaluation, and to eſteeme of it not as the word of man, but as it is indeed, as the word of God: for howſoeuer wee be ſinfull and mortall men, of the ſame mould and metall with your ſelues, that bring you this treaſure, yet is it the word of life which wee bring you. O let it dwell plentifully in you, that yee may abound in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and euery good worke, and loue and honour them which faithfully care for your matters.</p>

And not to inſtance in moe Scriptures; this wee may often obſerue in the Scriptures, that in reproofes of ſinne all are accuſed, if many haue offended. When therefore the Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>all ſeeke their owne, &amp;c.</hi> his meaning is, that it was growne to be a very generall fault amongſt thoſe Miniſters of the Goſpell that were with him, that very many of them ſought their owne, &amp;c. Againe, touching the fault noted in them, it is to be vnderſtood that the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:599:251"/> is not, that they ſought their owne, but not that which was Ieſus Chriſts at all: for it is very likely that the Apoſtle doth not here compare <hi>Timothee</hi> with thoſe that had fallen from the faith, and turned aſide after the world, but with thoſe that did ſincerely preach the Goſpell of Chriſt, yet were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in loue with the world than they ſhould haue beene. The Apoſtles meaning therefore I take it is, that many of thoſe that were with him ſought their owne; their owne, what? their owne eaſe, their owne profit, their owne honour, more than the glory of Chriſt Ieſus. They did not ſimply not ſeeke that which was Ieſus Chriſts, but they did not ſeeke that ſo much as they did ſeeke their owne. They looked more vnto their owne eaſe, and pleaſure, and profit, than they did vnto thoſe things which might be for the glory of Chriſt Ieſus, and for the increaſe of his kingdome. For it is very likely that the Apoſtle had dealt with the reſt to goe to <hi>Philippi,</hi> to ſee them, and to comfort them, and to confirme them in the faith: and finding them vnwilling to vndertake that iourney in diuers reſpects, he dealt with <hi>Timothee</hi> to that purpoſe. Vpon whoſe prompt minde thereunto aboue the reſt, hee giueth him this commendation aboue the reſt. They then whom the Apoſtle doth here note, yee ſee are of thoſe Miniſters of the Goſpell of Chriſt that were then with him. The thing which he noteth in them, is, that they ſought and regarded more the profit, and pleaſure, and eaſe, and honour of themſelues, than the glory of God, and the building vp of the Church of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>Here then firſt the Apoſtle deſcrieth a notable fault in the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus, which is to ſeeke their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts, to regard more their owne eaſe, or pleaſure, or profit, or honour, than the honour of God by preaching the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. A grieuous fault in them that both by integritie of life and vncorrupt doctrine ſhould draw others vnto God, that they ſhould ſeeke any thing rather or ſooner than the honour of God: for as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith,<note place="margin">

And how often doe the Prophets complaine of ſuch Shepheards as feede themſelues, and not their flockes? In the new Teſtament the Apoſtle noted it in <hi>Iohn Marke,</hi>

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 15 38.</note> that hee departed from him and <hi>Barnabas</hi> from <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and went not with them to the worke; in <hi>Demas,</hi> that hee forſooke him, and embraced this preſent world; and in this place hee notes (it ſeemes) many, that they ſought their owne, and not that which was Ieſus Chriſts. And if here this fault had ſtaied, the harme had beene the leſſe. But both alwayes there haue beene, and ſtill there are euen to this our day, many tainted with this fault: for not to ſpeake of thoſe monſters of men, rather than Miniſters of Chriſt, that intrude themſelues into this holy calling, not with any purpoſe to worke in the Lord his vineyard, but only to feed vpon the portion of the Leuites, making of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie no more but a plaine occupation; not to ſpeake, I ſay, of theſe, becauſe theſe are not worthy to liue; Of thoſe that doe ſincerely preach the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, are there not many that doe more ſeeke their owne than that which is Ieſus Chriſts? How many are there that doe withdraw their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from this burden as much and as often as they can, and take as little paines in this worke as they can? And doe not theſe ſeeke their owne eaſe more than that which is Ieſus Chriſts? Againe, how many are there whoſe mindes being bewitched with the loue of the world, are ſo carefully occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied about the things of this life, that they doe not intend the worke of their miniſterie as they ſhould? And doe not theſe ſeeke their owne profit more than that which is Ieſus Chriſts? Againe, how many are there that preach themſelues rather
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:599:252"/> than Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeking rather their owne praiſe than that which is of God, and ſtudying rather to ſpeake vnto the eare than vnto the heart? And doe not theſe ſeeke their owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and praiſe rather than that which is of Ieſus Chriſt? Againe, how many are there which preach Chriſt rather through ſtrife and enuie, than of good will; rather in hope of preferment for their paines, than of deſire to gaine them that heare them vnto Chriſt; rather for any other reſpect almoſt, than in any zeale of the glory of God? And doe not all theſe ſeeke their owne rather than that which is Ieſus Chriſts? Well, it is a fault, and a grieuous fault in the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus, in any reſpect to preferre any thing before the glory and increaſe of his kingdome whoſe Miniſters they are, to ſeeke either their owne eaſe, or their owne pleaſure, or their owne profit, or their owne honour, or any thing elſe rather or more than the building vp of Chriſt his Church in faith, and in loue, and in euery good worke of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be a fault in them, hereby wee are taught what dutie is requiſite in the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus, namely ſo to ſeeke their owne, as that firſt and principally they ſeeke that which is Ieſus Chriſts. And what is that? That is the glory of Chriſt Ieſus, the increaſe of his kingdome, the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of his Church vnto a ſpirituall Temple, the turning of many vnto righteouſneſſe, the ſaluation of mens ſoules.

Our calling and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus: a woe is vnto vs if wee preach not the Goſpell; and our Apoſtle moſt ſtraitly doth adiure vs vnto this dutie,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</note> ſaying, <hi>I charge thee before God, and before the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> The worke then of our miniſterie is the thing that wee haue to looke vnto; the thing wherein we muſt ſpend our ſtrength and our ſtudie, is to doe our heauenly Fathers buſineſſe in begetting men vnto the faith, and teaching them the way that leadeth vnto ſaluation and life euerlaſting. Wee muſt not ſeeke our owne, but that which is Ieſus Chriſts. Our Sauiour, when his mother <hi>Mary</hi> came and expoſtulated the matter with him, why hee ſtaied

                     <hi>that I must goe about my Fathers buſineſſe?</hi> Whereby hee plainly teacheth vs, that the principall thing wee are to regard is the principall end of our being and calling. So that this being our calling, and the thing whereunto wee are ſet apart, to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of God, wee are by Chriſt his example to minde this aboue all things elſe whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>What then? Muſt a Miniſter ſo wholly intend the worke of his miniſterie, as that he may not care for his familie? muſt he ſo weyne himſelfe from the affaires of this life, as that hee may not at all meddle with the things of this life? No, not ſo, he may and ought to care for his familie,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 8.</note> otherwiſe he is worſe then an Infidell. And againe the Apoſtle declaring in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular the office of a Miniſter, ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4.5.</note> he muſt be <hi>one that can rule his owne houſe honeſtly, hauing children in obedience with all hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: For</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>if he cannot rule his owne houſe, how ſhall be care for the Church of God?</hi> Out of which words yee may obſerue the clearing of two points; whereof the one is, that they may haue houſe and familie, wife and children; otherwiſe how ſhould the Apoſtle ſay that the Miniſter muſt be ſuch a one as hauing children vnder obedience, can rule his owne houſe honeſtly? The other is, that an honeſt and godly care ouer his owne houſe, and the things that belong thereunto, is very requiſite in the Miniſter of Chriſt Ieſus. All care then, and all ſeeking of his owne, all intermedling with the things of this life, is not ſimply forbid the Miniſter of Chriſt, but ſuch onely as doth withdraw him from that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hereon his principall care ſhould be ſet. Hee may ſeeke his owne, ſo that principally he ſeeke that which is Ieſus Chriſts: for that is the fault here noted, that they ſeeke their owne m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re then that which is Ieſus Chriſts; and that is the dutie here implied, that they ought firſt and principally to ſeeke that which is Ieſus Chriſts, and then that which is their owne. This then is generally to be concluded, that neither eaſe, nor pleaſure, nor profit, nor honour, nor any thing elſe ſhould withdraw them from the worke of their miniſterie, neither in the worke of their miniſterie ſhould their eye be ſet vpon any thing, but only vpon the glory of God, and the edification of
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:599:253"/> the Church of Chriſt Ieſus: and hereon ſhould their zeale be ſo ſet, that they ſhould be euen eaten vp and conſumed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note in theſe words, is touching the time when the Apoſtle noted this fault in the Miniſters of Chriſt. It was a fault, and a generall fault then in the time of the Apoſtles, in that golden age of the Church, when they that were immediately called by Chriſt Ieſus, and put apart to preach the Goſpell of God, taught the wayes of God moſt perfectly. Then euen thoſe Miniſters which had beene taught and inſtructed by the Apoſtles themſelues, thoſe whom the Apoſtles ceaſed not to put them in minde of their holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and of the duties belonging thereunto, euen they ſought their owne more then that which was Ieſus Chriſts: they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſome after their eaſe, ſome after their profit, ſome after their pleaſure, ſome after their honour, more than after the high price of their calling in Chriſt Ieſus. Which note I doe the rather obſerue in particular, becauſe of thoſe that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes complaining, as of all things in generall, that they were neuer worſe, ſo of the miniſterie in particular, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer worſe then now it is. For as this is the humor of very many, alwayes to miſlike the preſent ſtate the moſt, and to commend former times, though a great deale worſe, yet a great deale more then the times wherein they liue; ſo if once we come in talke of the Miniſterie, oh Miniſters neuer worſe, neuer more idle, neuer more couetous, neuer more ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then now they are. Yea enter this diſcourſe, and yee ſhall haue many will neuer want matter, but the more they talke, the more they may of this argument. And I wiſh wee were able to ſtop their mouthes when they ſo willingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the generall corruption in the miniſterie in our dayes, I wiſh wee were able to ſay truly that ſimply they ſpeake an vntruth. But I cannot, neither is it my purpoſe to excuſe the the faults of our times in the miniſterie. Bee it therefore true, which indeed is true, that very many of our coat and calling doe more ſeeke their owne then that which is Ieſus Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, is this fault now more generall in the Miniſters then euer it was? What, are Miniſters now more idle, doe they now
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:599:253"/> ſeeke their owne eaſe more then euer they did? Doth not the Apoſtle in his day note <hi>Iohn Marke</hi> for this fault?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 15.38.</note> Are they now more couetous, doe they now ſeeke their owne wealth more then euer they did? Doth not the Apoſtle in his day note <hi>Demas</hi> for this fault? Are they more ambitious,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10</note> doe they now ſeeke after and loue preeminence more then euer they did?<note place="margin">3 <hi>Joh</hi> 9.</note> Doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> in his day note <hi>Diotrephes</hi> for this fault? Oh, but if a note were now taken of thoſe that are faultie theſe wayes, not one, but very many ſhould bee found faultie each of theſe wayes. As though becauſe the Apoſtle noted no moe, there were then no moe. Nay, in that the Apoſtle noteth theſe of theſe faults, wee know that euen then the Miniſters of Chriſt were tainted with theſe faults, but how generally wee know not. But tell me ye that preſſe this point ſo hard, that Miniſters are now worſe then euer they were: ſay the moſt and the worſt ye can, can yee ſay more or worſe then this, that all ſeeke their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts? And ſaid not the Apoſtle thus much in his day, as here we ſee? The Apoſtle in his day meant it not vniuerſally of all, neither can yee ſay it at this day vniuerſally of all, that all ſeeke their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts. Nay if wee ſhall ſpeake vnto the point, that which the truth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am perſwaded that neuer in any age the number of faithfull Miniſters was greater then our age hath and doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord; neuer moe that with leſſe ſelfe-reſpects, and more zeale to Gods houſe, laboured in the worke of their miniſterie, then now there doe. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may be that the graces of Gods holy ſpirit were powred downe in greater meaſure and abundance vpon ſome in ſome times heretofore, then now they are, and that the word hath beene more powerfull through a greater operation of the holy ſpirit in the mouthes of ſome hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then now it is, as it was (no doubt) in the time of the Apoſtles, with whom the Lord wrought moſt powerfully and wonderfully, and as happily it hath beene in ſome ſince that time; yet, as I ſaid before, I am perſwaded that neuer in any time there were moe, more enflamed with the zeale of Gods ſpirit, faithfully, painfully, and ſincerely, without ſelfe reſpects, to labour in the worke of their miniſterie, and to
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:599:254"/> build vp Chriſt his Church in faith, and in loue, and in euery good worke, then now there are. For if we ſhould looke into all ſucceeding times after the time of the Apoſtles, eſpecially if we ſhould looke into the times ſince the myſterie of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beganne to worke in and vnder that man of ſinne, what elſe ſhould we finde but idleneſſe, and couetouſneſſe, and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and ambition, and what wickedneſſe not? Hee hath lifted vp himſelfe on high,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4.</note> and <hi>hath exalted himſelfe againſt all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, ſo that hee doth ſit as God in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God.</hi> And what elſe doth his whole Clergie ſeeke, but the abetting of his pride, and the maintaining of his triple Crowne, together with ſuch eaſe, and pleaſure, and profit, as followes thereupon? So that if euer it were truly ſaid of any, that they ſought their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts, then in my iudgement may it as truly be ſaid of them as of any. Thus then yee ſee that it is not the fault of our time alone, that now Miniſters ſeeke their owne more then that which is Ieſus Chriſts, but that euen in the Apoſtles time it was ſo, as alſo that how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſoeuer the fault now be, yet is it not more generall then euer it was, but rather the number of them that ſeeke that which is Ieſus Chriſts more then their owne, is now greater then euer it was. Take heed therefore, men and brethren, leſt at any time ye be deceiued. The Miniſters of Chriſt they ate as beacons on the top of an hill, in euery mans eye, and euery mans tongue talking of them, and what talke of them more common, then of branding them with ſome fault or other, thereby to diſcredit that truth which they preach? It is no new thing, yee ſee, that Miniſters haue their faults, and hee is the beſt that hath the feweſt. And howſoeuer they tell you that Miniſters are now worſe then euer they were, beleeue them not: for if the worſt be ſaid that can be, there cannot be worſe then this, that all ſeeke their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts; and thus much ſaid the Apoſtle in his time.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt thing which I note from theſe words, is, that howſoeuer properly, and in the meaning of the Apoſtle, theſe words in this place be onely affirmed of the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus, yet may they truly be affirmed euen of all men
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:599:254"/> in generall, that all men for the moſt part doe ſeeke their owne more then that which is Ieſus Chriſts, firſt looking vnto the things of this life, and then afterwards vnto the things that belong vnto their peace in Chriſt Ieſus. This is a point which needs not long to be ſtood vpon, being ſo plaine a truth in our owne experience, that which way ſoeuer we caſt our eyes, vnto high or low, rich or poore, it cannot be denied. For looke into the delights and deſires of men, and ſee what it is that they principally hunt and ſeeke after. Are there not many that are ſo ambitious, that they ſeeke by all meanes poſſible to be great, and to be had in honour of all men? And yet how many of them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.</note> remembring that promotion commeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor yet from the South, but that God alone putteth downe one, and ſetteth vp another, doe firſt ſeeke the Lord and his ſtrength, and doe firſt honour him, that ſo he may honour them before all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Nay euery plot is ſooner and oftener caſt then this, and this comes ſeldome or neuer within their thoughts, or if it doe, yet this is too ſlow a courſe for them, God muſt giue them leaue to climbe vp another way, and then when they are where they would be, they will ſerue him perhaps when they thinke of him. Againe, are there not many that are ſo coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, that they ſeeke by all meanes to be rich, and to be Lords (if it were poſſible) of the whole earth? And yet how many of them remembring that the Lord maketh poore and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth rich, doe firſt ſeeke the Lord, ſo to become rich by him? Nay if fraud, oppreſſion, vſurie, or the like will make them rich, they will not wait vpon the Lord, but thus they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich. Yea but theſe, and ſuch like, as ſeeke and delight only in pleaſures, and idleneſſe, and riches, and honour, and the like, they ſeeke theſe things altogether, they ſeeke not the Lord at all, neither is God in all their thoughts: but thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt the Lord, and delighteſt in his Law. And ſo doe many, which yet ſeeke their owne more then that which is Ieſus Chriſts. Wilt thou then ſee whether thine owne things or the things of Chriſt Ieſus be more ſought of thee, whether in ſome things thou preferre not thy ſelfe before thy Chriſt and his will? Aske thine owne heart, and ſee whether if thy God

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow the Apoſtle in theſe words, to cleere <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothee</hi> of that fault wherewith very many of the reſt were tainted, that hee ſought not his owne more than that which was Ieſus Chriſts, he asketh no other or better proofe thereof then their owne knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of him, for that they knew very well that <hi>Timothee</hi> as a ſonne with the father, ſerued with the Apoſtle the Lord Chriſt in preaching of his Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But yee</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>know the proofe of him, &amp;c.]</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid, The reſt that are with mee, at leaſt very many of them, ſeeke their owne more then that which is Ieſus Chriſts. But for <hi>Timothee,</hi> your ſelues will ſerue to cleere him of this fault: yee know vpon that knowledge and proofe which yee haue of him, that hee is another kinde of man, that he hath ſerued with me, euen as a ſonne with his father, whom? Chriſt Ieſus: wherein? in the Goſpell, that is, in the preaching of the Goſpell, his miniſterie is fully knowne vnto you, that both he and I haue walked after one rule in preaching of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, euen that wee haue walked as the father and the ſonne in the ſelfe ſame ſteps, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the building of the ſpirituall Temple of Chriſt Ieſus, hee walking as hee hath mee for example. This I take to bee the Apoſtle his meaning in theſe words. The notes hence to bee obſerued I will rather point at, then much ſtand vpon, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this place and auditorie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence I note that <hi>Timothy</hi> whom the Apoſtle ſent vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> was a man of whom they had had proofe and experience before, and whoſe faithfulneſſe in the worke of his miniſtery was ſo well knowne vnto them that they could not
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:599:256"/> doubt thereof. And this was the cauſe why the Apoſtle thought it not needfull to labour much in the clearing of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> from ſuch faults as had infected the reſt, or in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of his commendation: they knew that as a ſon with the father, ſo he had laboured with the Apoſtle in preaching the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. A thing whereunto euen all the miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus ought moſt earneſtly to ſtriue, by their faithfull and carefull walking in the workes of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to approue themſelues, not onely before the Lord, but alſo before men, to be the faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt Ieſus. Yea but here is all the skill to do ſo: or rather it ſeemeth a thing impoſſible to approue our ſelues both before the Lord, and alſo before men. For if we yet ſhould pleaſe men we were not the ſeruants of Chriſt. And therefore the Apoſtle in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place proteſteth againſt pleaſing of men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.</note> and ſaith, <hi>we ſo ſpeake, not as they that pleaſe men, but God which trieth our hearts.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4.</note> How is it then poſſible for vs to approue our ſelues both before God, and before men? True, it is a matter of no ſmall difficulty. If we crie peace, peace, all is well, if we ſew cuſhions vnder their elbowes, and ſpeake faire and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, if we ſuffer them to take their fill of pleaſure, and to wallow in their wickedneſſe, and either ſay nought vnto them, or runne with them, happily wee may pleaſe men, but doubtleſſe we ſhall not pleaſe God. Againe, if we crie aloude and lift vp our voices like trumpets, and tell the houſe of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> their ſinnes, and the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> their tranſgreſſions, if we rouſe them out of that dead ſleepe of ſinne whereinto they are fallen, and lay the axe to the roote of ſinne to cut it vp by the rootes; if we poure vineger into ſuch wounds as fin hath made in their ſoules, and denounce the ſharp threatnings of the law againſt them, happily wee may approue our ſelues vnto the Lord, but doubtleſſe we ſhall not approue our ſelues vnto men. Nay what almoſt can we ſay or doe, whereby wee ſhall be able to approue our ſelues both before the Lord, and before men? What then? are we to ſtriue vnto an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? Not ſo neither; but this being out of doubt that wee ought to approue our ſelues before the Lord whoſe Miniſters we are, and whoſe name wee beare before our people; wee
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:599:256"/> ought likewiſe ſo faithfully and carefully to walke in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before men, as that vnto their conſciences wee may giue certaine proofes that we are the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt. We cannot alwaies ſo approue our ſelues vnto men, as that what we ſay or doe ſhall pleaſe them, neither doe we or ought we to ſtriue thereunto; but we may and ought ſo to worke the work of our miniſtery, and to doe the duties of our calling as that they ought to approue vs, and may know that we are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Ieſus Chriſt, howſoeuer wee come vnto them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>with a rodde, or in loue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21</note> 
                     <hi>and in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekneſſe.</hi> For whether wee come with a rodde, or in loue, and in the ſpirit of meekneſſe, whether we improue, or correct, or inſtruct, or exhort, or rebuke, our care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour therein is to approue our ſelues vnto him whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters wee are, and that wee may bee found faithfull among you.</p>
                  <p>Now as we ought thus to approue our ſelues vnto you, and by our faithfull walking in our calling to giue ſuch proofe of our ſelues vnto you that ye may know that indeede wee ſerue the Lord in the Goſpell; ſo againe ought yee to take heede of approuing any who giues not plaine proofe that he ſerues the Lord in the Goſpell. They whom ye muſt approue, muſt bee ſuch as ſeeke not yours but you, ſuch as firſt ſeeke that which is the Lord Ieſus Chriſts, and then that which is their owne, ſuch as ye know by your owne proofe that they ſerue their Lord Ieſus Chriſt in preaching of his Goſpell, and not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or any elſe whomſoeuer. For from their lips ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue knowledge and inſtruction, and by their mouth ye ſhall be taught in the waies of the Lord, and in the workes of his commandements. For they ſeruing the Lord Ieſus from their hearts purely out of the abundance of their hearts endite good matters, and their tongue is as the penne of a ready writer. Now whether all of this congregation approue ſuch, and none but ſuch, your ſelues can better tell then behoueth me to iudge. But not to diſſemble my feare, I am in feare, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>of ſome of you,</hi> that you more approue of ſuch as ſerue that man of ſinne in ſeducing you by traditions, then of ſuch as ſerue the Lord in the preaching of the Goſpell. The
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:599:257"/> Apoſtle ye know maketh mention of ſome bad ones, it is eaſie to geſſe who at this day doe moſt reſemble them,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.6.</note> which creep into houſes, and lead captiue ſimple women laden with ſins, and led with diuers luſts &amp;c. And our Sauiour likwiſe maketh mention of ſuch as compaſſe ſea and land to make one of their profeſſion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.15</note> and when hee is made they make him two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold more the childe of hell then they themſelues are. I feare leaſt ſome of them haue beguiled ſome of you, and ſeduced your fooliſh hearts that ye ſhould not hearken and obey the holy word of life, which onely is able to make you wiſe vnto ſaluation through the faith which is in Chriſt Ieſus. For how elſe commeth it to paſſe that ſome doe ſo ſeldome preſent themſelues in the holy place where they might heare the things that belong vnto their peace? And how elſe commeth it to paſſe, that ſome when the Preacher beginnes make an end of their deuotion, and leauing the houſe of God go to their owne houſes? Haue they any exception againſt vs? Doe we teach for doctrines mens precepts? Doe wee handle the word deceitfully? Do we keepe backe any of Gods counſell? Nay in all theſe things, as in the whole worke of our miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie we ſtudy to approue our ſelues both before the Lord, and before men. An exception they haue, but almoſt they know not what. The truth is; they are not able to trie the ſpirits whether they are of God. And therefore they approue them which prophecie lies vnto them out of their owne braine. But ye beloued learne to know and approue him who giues plaine proofe that he ſerues the Lord in the Goſpell, in the ſincere and faithfull preaching thereof.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but ye will ſay vnto mee, wee would gladly approue them that ſerue the Lord in the Goſpell. But how ſhall wee know who ſerue the Lord in the Goſpell? For they that are wholy deuoted vnto the ſeruice of that man of ſinne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy lies out of their owne braine will ſay that they ſerue the Lord in the Goſpel, aſwell as they will which ſincerely preach the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus vnto the confuſion of that man of ſinne. Note therefore that the Apoſtle in this place doth not ſimply ſay of <hi>Timothy</hi> that he ſerued the Lord in the Goſpell, but that he ſerued with him in the Goſpell. Wherin he giueth
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:599:257"/> him this teſtimonie that hee did ſincerely teach Chriſt Ieſus, preaching no other Goſpell then that which the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe preached, but walking in the ſame ſteppes with him vnto the building of the ſpirituall temple of Chriſt Ieſus, euen as he had him for example. Will yee then know who they are that ſerue the Lord in the Goſpell? Euen they that ſerue the Lord in the Goſpell with <hi>Paul,</hi> they that preach no other Goſpell then <hi>Paul</hi> preached, they which ground the doctrines which they teach, not vpon mens precepts, but vpon the ſure foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles. Trie therefore who they are that walke as they haue the Apoſtle for example, ſee who they are that after his example teſtifie the kingdome of God, and preach vnto the people concerning Chriſt Ieſus out of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and out of the Prophets.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 28.23.17.11.</note> It is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred ye know, vnto the great commendation of the men of <hi>Berea,</hi> that they ſearched the Scriptures daily, and ſought whether the things which they heard of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were ſo. Obſerue the ſame rule: ſearch the Scriptures; for they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of Chriſt and of his truth. It is our deſire that ye would trie by this rule both vs, and them which teach otherwiſe then we teach; and then that yee would approue them whom by proofe ye ſhall know to ſerue the Lord with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. The rule which wee haue giuen whereby to know them that ſerue the Lord in the Goſpel is moſt certaine and ſure, and it ſtandeth you aſwell vpon to approue them, &amp; them alone, who giue plaine proofe that they ſerue the Lord in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as it ſtandeth vs vpon to labour by faithfull walking in our calling to approue our ſelues before the Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men.</p>
                  <p>The next thing which I note out of theſe words is, that which the Apoſtle addeth by way of amplification, that <hi>Timothy</hi> ſeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Paul</hi> as a ſonne with the father, for the Apoſtle doth not ſimply ſay, ye know the proofe of him that he hath ſerued with me in the Goſpell, but by way of amplification vnto <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus</hi> greater commendation he addeth, that as a ſon with the father he had ſerued with him &amp;c. Whence I obſerue a notable example of that modeſty and reuerence which ought to be in particular in younger Miniſters towards them that
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:599:258"/> are their auncients and haue gone before them in that worke, and which ought to be in generall in all the ſonnes of God towards their Elders, but eſpecially towards thoſe that haue begotten them in the faith. Young <hi>Timothy</hi> ſeruing with aged <hi>Paul</hi> in the Goſpell euen as a ſon with his father, ſhould teach younger Miniſters to honour and to reuerence their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in the miniſtery, and to walke as they haue them for example, eſpecially if they walke as aged <hi>Paul</hi> did faithfully and painfully in the workes of their calling. Otherwiſe, if they delight in idleneſſe, or mind earthly things, if they ſeeke their owne more then that which is Ieſus Chriſts, they are to be no more patternes vnto vs to follow then the examples of old <hi>Eli,</hi> or <hi>Demas,</hi> or the like. Nay I thinke the younger may and ought, yet with all modeſty becauſe of their yeeres, to put them in minde of their duties, and to beſeech them that as fathers they will go before them in all holineſſe of example, with incorrupt doctrine, with grauitie, integritie, and with the wholeſome word which cannot be reproued. But if they walke as aged <hi>Paul</hi> did faithfully, and painefully in the worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of their calling, if in all holineſſe of example they walke before them, as fathers before their children, if as fathers they haue begotten them in the faith, then ſurely ought the younger Miniſters to honour and to reuerence them euen as ſons do their fathers, and as <hi>Timothy</hi> did honour <hi>Paul.</hi> A note wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hy the vrging and enlarging if the place were as conuenient for the vrging of it as the time requireth the vrging of it. A ſonne will not eaſily get himſelfe vp to the toppe of an hill thence to glance at ſuch things as may turne to his fathers ſhame, much leſſe thence to caſt dung in his face, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to ſpeake ſuch things as iuſtly may grieue him, leaſt of all vpon an imagined error in his father will he thence loade him with blaſphemies. A ſonne, I ſay, will not thus doe, and a miniſter ſhould not thus do. For he ſhould ſerue the Lord with him in the Goſpell, as a ſonne with the father.</p>
                  <p>Againe, young <hi>Timothy</hi> vſed himſelfe towards aged <hi>Paul</hi> as a ſonne towards his father. A good leſſon for thoſe of yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger yeeres to teach them in what regard they ought to haue their elders and their betters; they ought to honour and to
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:599:258"/> reuerence them, and to performe other duties vnto them in ſome ſort as to their fathers. For ſo we ſee the Scripture would haue them accounted as fathers, as where the admonition is, rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father, and the elder women as mothers. And the faſhion and cuſtome of them is good whoſe manner it is to ſalute elder men as fathers,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1.2.</note> &amp; el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der women as mothers. I doe only point at this note by the way, becauſe of the ill education of many of our youth, who regard not at all the gray haires of the aged, but oftentimes moſt contumeliouſly do abuſe them, calling them old fooles, dooting fooles, and the like. Well, the precept is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.32.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe vp before the hoare-head, and honour the perſon of the old man.</hi> But this puniſhment is iuſt with the Lord vnto him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenceth not the perſon of the old man, that either hee ſhall not come vnto the honour of old age, or elſe his old age ſhall be without honour.</p>
                  <p>But an eſpeciall thing which all of vs hence ſhould learne is, how we ſhould walke in reſpect of them that haue begot vs in the faith of Chriſt Ieſus. As Timothy regarded Paul who had begot him in the faith, ſo muſt we regard thoſe that haue begot vs in the faith, euen as a ſonne carrieth himſelfe towards his father, ſo ſhould we carrie our ſelues towards them. And therefore are they called our ſpirituall fathers in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and we their ſonnes if by their miniſtery they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten vs in the faith. <hi>I beſeech thee,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon, for my ſonne Oneſimus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>whom I haue begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in my bonds:</hi> where he calleth <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his ſonne. In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, Though yee haue,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>tenne thouſand Inſtructors in Chriſt, yet haue ye not many fathers: for in Chriſt Ieſus I haue begotten you through the Goſpell:</hi> Where he calleth himſelfe their father in the ſame reſpect that before he called <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his ſonne, euen becauſe hee had begotten them in the faith. And in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19.</note> 
                     <hi>My little children,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>of whom I trauell in birth againe vntill Chriſt be formed in you:</hi> where he ſheweth that he was a mother, and they as the ſonnes of his wombe. And wherfore is it that the miniſters of Chriſt his Goſpell are thus called our fathers, and mothers as it were, and we their ſonnes, but to note vnto
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:599:259"/> vs that we haue our life in Chriſt Ieſus through their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſo to put vs in minde of that duty which we owe vnto them in reſpect of our regeneration and new birth by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeede of God his word through their miniſtery. Looke then what honour is due by children vnto their parents, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be reuerence, or obedience, or maintenance, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer elſe it be, the ſame wee muſt account due by vs vnto our ſpirituall fathers in Chriſt Ieſus.

                  <p>Now followeth the concluſion of his firſt promiſe, which was to ſend <hi>Timotheus</hi> vnto them, in theſe words, <hi>him therefore I hope &amp;c.</hi> Wherein is ſet downe the repetition of the former promiſe, and likewiſe a farther ſignification of the time when he would ſend him. <hi>Him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I hope to ſend,</hi> there is the repetition of the former promiſe; <hi>as ſoone as I know how it will go with me,</hi> here is the ſignification of the time when he would ſend him. Before he had ſaid, <hi>I truſt to ſend Timotheus ſhortly vnto you,</hi> now he ſheweth what he meant by that ſhortly, that is as ſoone as he ſhould know whether he ſhould be deliuered from his bonds by <hi>Nero,</hi> which he hoped ſhould bee ſhortly. And the cauſe why he ſent him not preſently with <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was becauſe as yet he knew not certainely how his matters would go, and he was very deſirous that at his <hi>Timotheus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto them they might bee comforted ouer his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from his bonds. I haue already pointed at ſuch notes as I thought meete to bee gathered from this promiſe. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I truſt in the Lord]</hi> In theſe words he putteth them in hope of his owne comming ſhortly vnto them. Which his promiſe, as the other dependeth vpon the hope of his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of priſon. This hope alſo of his comming vnto them he putteth them in for their farther comfort, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for their farther confirmation in the faith. Whence 1. we may note the Apoſtle his great care that they might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and therein obſerue the great care that the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus ſhould haue of the comfort of their people in the times of their diſtreſſes: of which note wee haue already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before. 2. We may note the Apoſtle his great care that they might grow ſtrong in the faith, and abound in euery good worke vnto the glory of God the father. And this care ought alſo to be in the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus towards their people, as alſo I haue heretofore obſerued. Only here remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one doubt to be anſwered. For here ſome happily will
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:599:260"/> aske, how it fell out with this hope and confidence of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, was he deceiued of his hope and confidence, or did he as he hoped he ſhould ſend <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhortly after vnto them, did he as he truſted he ſhould come himſelfe ſhortly after vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? Whereunto 1. I anſwere, what if he were deceiued of his hope and confidence? doth this at all impaire his credit and authority? If it had beene a matter of faith and doctrine it ſhould. But this was a thing caſuall and contingint, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might be deceiued, and yet his credit no whit diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For albeit he had the ſpirit of truth to lead him into all truth in whatſoeuer doctrine hee deliuered vnto the Church. Yet in things that concerned himſelfe, eſpecially in things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and contingent might he be deceiued; euen as we ſee in this place that albeit he had the gift of healing, yet <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> whom hee dearely loued had like to haue died with him. 2. I anſwere that whether hee were deceiued of his hope and confidence or no, I cannot certainely tell, becauſe it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not by the Scriptures. But very well it might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is ſure, hee truſted in the Lord to come vnto them, and to ſee them, that ſo they might bee comforted one in another, and that hee might confirme and ſtrengthen them in the faith. And let this be ſpoken touching his ſecond promiſe.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t I ſuppoſed it neceſſarie]</hi> In this laſt part of this Chapter which concerneth <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the Apoſtle 1. ſignifieth his preſent ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> backe againe vnto them. 2. He ſetteth downe the cauſes why he ſent him now preſently, and ſtaied him not till either <hi>Timothy,</hi> or himſelfe ſhould come vnto them, or till hee ſhould certainely know how his matters would go, whether he ſhould be deliuered out of priſon, or no: laſtly he praieth them to receiue him with gladneſſe, and to make much of him, and ſuch as he is. Touching <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> it appeareth that he was the Miniſter of the Church at <hi>Philippy;</hi> one that ſo laboured in the worke of his miniſterie as that he approued himſelfe very well both vnto the Apoſtle, and vnto the whole Church at <hi>Philippy.</hi> When the <hi>Philippians</hi> had heard that <hi>Paul</hi> was taken priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſent this their Miniſter <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> to ſee him, and to carie him ſome reliefe from them, and there to abide with him, as it may ſeeme, during his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and to miniſter vnto him ſuch things as hee needed. Which truſt of the Church, and duty vnto <hi>Paul</hi> whilſt he faithfully and painefully diſcharged, he fell into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and grieuous ſickneſſe, ſo that he was very neere vnto death, euen at deaths doore as we ſay. Yet ſuch was the Lord his mercy towards him, neither towards him onely, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe towards <hi>Paul,</hi> whom his ſickneſſe had very much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that he reſtored him vnto health againe. But when hee heard that the <hi>Philippians</hi> had heard of his ſickneſſe, hee grew full of heauineſſe, fearing leaſt theſe two things, both <hi>Pauls</hi>
                     <pb n="498" facs="tcp:599:261"/> bands, and his ſickneſſe ſhould bring too much griefe and ſorrow vnto the Church. Being therefore deſirous to returne vnto them, and againe being very loth, and happily not well daring to goe, and leaue <hi>Paul</hi> in priſon, he was marueilouſly perplexed what to doe, and grew full of ſadnes and heauines. Which when the Apoſtle perceiued, and vnderſtood that the <hi>Philippians</hi> were much moued at his ſicknes, he thought it neceſſarie both for his and their comfort to ſend him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto them, as here he ſaith, <hi>I ſuppoſed it neceſſarie &amp;c.</hi> And this may ſerue for a generall view of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Now for a more particular view of theſe words, ſee how the Apoſtle, leaſt the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould ſuſpect that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> had ſome way not approued himſelfe vnto him, becauſe he ſent him backe before ſuch time as he knew certainely how things would goe with him; ſee (I ſay) what great titles he honoureth him withall, thereby to witnes vnto them what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he made of him, and of his ſeruice whiles he was with him. 1. He calleth him his brother, to wit in Chriſt, begotten in one faith, by one Goſpell, vnto one God, which is aboue all, and through all, and in vs all. 2. He calleth him his companion in labour, as in diuers places hee doth diuers others who laboured with him in the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt Ieſus, and in the building vp of his bodie. 3. He calleth him his fellow ſouldier, as alſo he doth <hi>Archippus</hi> in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> one that fought againſt ſpirituall wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes, as he did, and did not onely preach as he did, but alſo ſuffer troubles, and endure manifold tentations as he did. 4. He calleth him their meſſenger, whom the whole Church at <hi>Philippi</hi> ſent vnto him to viſit him at <hi>Rome</hi> where he lay in priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo the word <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here vſed in the originall is very well tranſlated in our Engliſh Bibles. Laſtly, he ſaith of him, that he was one that miniſtred vnto him ſuch things as he wanted, which (I thinke) he ſaith, both in reſpect of that reliefe which he brought vnto <hi>Paul</hi> from the <hi>Philippians;</hi> and likewiſe in reſpect of that great vſe which he had of him all the while he was with him. Thus then yee ſee how the Apoſtle thinking it neceſſarie to ſend <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> home vnto them for ſuch cauſes as afterwards he mentioneth, ſendeth
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:599:261"/> him loden with commendations, leſt happily they ſhould iudge of him at his returne vnto them in any reſpect other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then were meete. Now let vs ſee what notes and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations we may gather hence for our vſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the ſending of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> at this time vnto the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> I note the ſingular great care of the Apoſtle ouer thoſe whom he had begotten in the faith of Chriſt Ieſus. He was now in priſon, he knew not certainely when, or whether he ſhould be deliuered out of priſon, or no; and beſides this, it ſeemes that there were very few of the reſt that were with him, ſaue he onely, and <hi>Timothie,</hi> in whom the Apoſtle did or could take any great comfort. For as we heard a litle before, all the reſt that were with him, ſurely very many of them ſought their owne, their owne eaſe, their owne pleaſure, their owne profit, their owne honor &amp;c, not that which was Ieſus Chriſts, not that ſo much as they ſought their owne eaſe, or honour, or pleaſure, or profit, or the like. Though therefore both <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> were deſirous to goe to them, and they likewiſe deſirous to ſee him, yet a man would haue thought here had beene ſufficient matter of excuſe, eſpecially vnto them who ought vnto him not their Miniſter alone but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo. Yet ſuch was his loue towards them, and ſuch was his care of their comfort, that he preferred that before his owne neceſſitie, more regarding their good then his owne neede.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſhould this teach vs: Surely it ſhould teach euen all the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus this leſſon, ſo to tender their good, and their comfort in Chriſt Ieſus ouer whom the Lord hath made them ouerſeers, as that they ſhould more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the things that belong vnto their peace, then the things that belong vnto their owne eſtate. Yea though they ſhould be offered vp vpon the ſacrifice of their faith, that is, though they ſhould giue vp their liues for an offering vnto the Lord for the confirmation and ſtrengthning of their faith, yet ſhould they therein euen be glad and reioyce; ſo that they ſhould not loue their liues vnto the death, if ſo their death might be for a ſauing health vnto their people. To vrge the neceſſitie of this dutie, or to complaine of the neglect of this
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:599:262"/> dutie, though our times require it, yet this place is not ſo fit for it. And beſides euery where almoſt our people can tell vs of our dutie, and can open their mouthes wide to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of our negligence in our dutie. But if our care muſt be ſuch for you, that we muſt care more for you then for our ſelues, what doe yee thinke ſhould againe be your care? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yee ſhould as new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of Gods word, your care ſhould be by our miniſterie to grow vp in the knowledge of his will, and in all obedience thereunto, and this yee ſhould more care for then for all the things of this life whatſoeuer. Yet care we neuer ſo much for your ſauing health, labour we neuer ſo much to breede the loue of God, and of his word in you, ſo to gaine you vnto Chriſt; though we be altogether careleſſe in our owne matters, and onely carefull that yee may know Chriſt and him crucified, what ſenſe or feeling of religion, what loue of God or godlineſſe, what longing or thirſting after the holy word of life which is onely able to make you wiſe vnto ſaluation through faith in Chriſt Ieſus, doe we beget and engender in you? Nay euery petty excuſe ſhall ſerue for good enough to keepe you from comming vnto the courſes of Gods houſe, and preſenting your ſelues in the holy place, where yee might heare the things that belong vnto your peace. Some are too olde to be taught euen in the waies of God, though they know them not at all; and ſome are ſo yong that they may learne all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo much as will ſerue their turne: ſome haue ſuch buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that they cannot come: ſome are ſo froward and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate that they will not come: ſome are ſo idle that they liſt not to come: ſome can doe as much good at home as if they came; and ſome would come oftner then they doe if they might haue another Preacher then they haue. Thus this, and that, &amp; I know not what ſtaies vs too too much from waſhing our ſelues in thoſe waters whereby we might be cleanſed from all leproſie of ſinne; and plainely ſhew that we care not for the things that belong vnto our peace. Nay where is there greater oppoſition in the people againſt their Miniſter, and ſome things that they teach, then where the Miniſter is moſt painefull and carefull that he may preſent his people holy
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:599:262"/> vnto the Lord? And will yee know whence it is that ſo litle care of growing vp in the knowledge of Gods will, and of walking in the waies of his commandements is in the people, notwithſtanding the neuer ſo great carefulneſſe in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> may water,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.7.</note> but vnleſſe God doe giue the increaſe, <hi>Pauls</hi> planting, and <hi>Apollos</hi> watring are not any thing, to no purpoſe at all. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus may like good watchmen ſtand vpon their watch, and giue warning from the Lord; they may labour in all good conſcience and with all carefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſtirre vp their people vnto a godly care of walking ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; but vnleſſe God doe ſtirre vp this care in them by the power of his holy ſpirit, the Miniſter ſpendeth his ſtrength in vaine and for nothing in reſpect of them. Hence then it is that there is ſo litle care of growing vp in the knowledge of Gods will, and in all obedience thereunto, euen becauſe the peoples hearts are not ſo ſoftned and mollified by Gods holy ſpirit that they ſhould take care of the things that belong vnto their peace, but lying ſtill in the hardnes of their hearts they onely minde earthly things, and ſet not their affections on the things that are aboue. Examine therefore your ſelues, men and brethren, and ſee whether there be in you that care to grow vp by the miniſterie of the word in all holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, which you perſwade your ſelues ought to be in the Miniſter of Chriſt, that ſo yee may grow vp. For if I ſhould at large haue diſcourſed of that care which ought to be in the Miniſter towards you, which I onely touched, I doubt not but yee would haue eaſily aſſented thereunto: nay yee thinke yee can diſcourſe, at leaſt yee will take vpon you to diſcourſe largely enough of that point your ſelues. See then whether there be in you ſuch an ardent and an inflamed deſire to grow vp by the miniſterie of the word, as yee thinke there ſhould be in the Miniſter that yee may be profited by his miniſterie. If yee feele no ſuch care and deſire in you, it is becauſe the Lord hath not as yet by his powerfull ſpirit wrought this holy care and deſire in you. Striue therefore by praier vnto the Lord for the grace of his holy ſpirit, whereby
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:599:263"/> yee may be ſtirred vp vnto this care and deſire, and frequent with all diligence places of holy and religious exerciſes, that ſo that weake and languiſhing deſire which is in you, by the power of Gods Spirit working with the word, may be raiſed and increaſed. As for you whoſe hearts the Lord hath infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a godly care and deſire that yee may grow vp in all knowledge of Gods will, and in all obedience thereunto, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on hard toward the marke for the prize of the high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God in Chriſt Ieſus; goe on from grace to grace, from ſtrength to ſtrength, and this I pray, as our Apoſtle doth in the former chapter, <hi>that your loue may abound yet more and more in knowledge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and in all iudgement &amp;c.</hi> In a word, let thoſe that are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpoſers of Gods ſecrets, ſo tender their good ouer whom the Lord hath made them ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, that they more regard the things that belong vnto their peace, then the things that belong vnto their owne eſtate. And againe, yee that heare the law of the Lord at their mouthes, and are taught in the waies of your God by their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, ſo care to grow vp by their miniſterie in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods will, and in all obedience thereunto, that yee care more for that then for all things elſe of this life whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. And let this ſerue for our firſt note.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this great commendation of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and in theſe many titles wherewith the Apoſtle honoureth him, I note the Apoſtle his great modeſtie towards thoſe that were called to bee Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus, and walked with a ſtraight foote vnto the worke of their miniſtration. <hi>Paul</hi> had many and moſt excellent prerogatiues aboue him, yet doth he call him his brother in Chriſt: <hi>Paul</hi> was called immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly by Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe to be an Apoſtle, and put apart by him to preach the Goſpell of God, and filled with gifts and graces aboue others to that purpoſe, and laboured more abundantly in preaching of the Goſpell of Chriſt then the reſt, yet doth he call <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his companion in labour, and in preaching of Chriſt his Goſpell: <hi>Paul</hi> was in ſtripes, in priſon, in perils, in perſecutions, and in death more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and more often then the reſt of the Apoſtles, yet doth he call <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his fellow ſouldier, and one that fought
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:599:263"/> againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, and ſuffered many troubles, and endured manifold tentations as he did. In one word, he was euery way farre and incomparably aboue him, yet doth he make him one as it were, and almoſt equall with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and highly honor and magnifie the gifts and graces of Gods holy ſpirit in him, neither doth he account it any diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement vnto himſelfe to doe ſo.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſhould this teach vs? Surely this ſhould be a leſſon vnto all in generall whom the Lord hath any way ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced aboue their brethren, not to deſpiſe the meaneſt of their brethren; and in particular vnto thoſe of greater pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the miniſterie, that they ſhould not extenuate and leſſen the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Firſt therefore in generall, it is the rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>that no man ſhould deſpiſe another, but that euery man ſhould make himſelfe equall vnto them of the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> the high vnto the low, the rich vnto the poore, the wiſe and man of vnderſtanding vnto the ſimple and ignorant. <hi>For what haſt thou, ô man, that thou haſt not receiued?</hi> Is thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and promotion great?<note place="margin">

But doe they not rather glory in theſe things, as though they had not receiued them, or at leaſt knew not for what end they had receiued them? When they are become as great as <hi>Haman,</hi> doe they not proue like vnto <hi>Haman,</hi> euen ſuch as thinke of nothing but of oppreſſing, and vndoing, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the people of God? When they are become as rich as <hi>Nabal,</hi> doe they not proue as churliſh and as ill conditioned as <hi>Nabal,</hi> euen ſuch as will part with nothing for the releeuing of the neceſſities of the poore Saints of God?

The world ſeeth, and let the world iudge whether it be ſo, or no. As for vs, men and brethren, let vs know, that the wiſe man is not to glory in his wiſdome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man in his riches, but he that reioyceth is to reioyce in the Lord, who giueth him wiſdome,

Neither is he for theſe things, or any things of like ſort, to aduance himſelf aboue his brethren, as though he were the man vnto whom all men ſhould bowe, and on whom all mens eyes ſhould be ſet; but he is ſo to vſe theſe things to Gods glory, and to the good and comfort of his brethren, and to make himſelfe equall vnto them of the loweſt degree. This (I ſay) let vs know, and let our knowledge breake forth into all holy practiſe, that ſo we may liue without pride, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and contempt one of another, ſubmitting your ſelues one vnto another, euery man eſteeming other better than himſelfe, and communicating the things wherewithall God hath bleſſed vs, whether wiſdome, or knowledge, or riches, or what elſe ſoeuer to the good one of another with all cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, and in all ſingleneſſe of heart.

In the preaching of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, and in the building vp of his body by the worke of his miniſterie. What then? Is preaching of the Goſpell of God ſuch a labour? Is the worke of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the teaching of the people in the waies of God ſuch a matter that it is to be counted or called a labour? Surely no, in many mens account it is not. An eaſie matter and no labor at all for a Miniſter to ſpeake an houre vnto his people. What paines can this take him? What toyle can be in this worke? No more but turne the cocke, and then the water guſhes out. He is either worth litle, or elſe too too dainty, that will not come at euery call vnto the people to preach to them. Thus many account this worke litle or no labour.

Now how this dutie towards them is euery where almoſt neglected, they that liue abroad ſee and know too well: for ſo it is, that euery little is now too much for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; if he may haue ſome reaſonable portion of that whole which is due vnto him, it is thought that he is very well vſed; if any thing of his due may be concealed and kept from him, it is thought to be very well ſaued, and better ſo ſaued then ill ſpent: for ſo commonly they account of that which they giue vnto the Miniſter, albeit it be not theirs, but his which they giue. Farre otherwiſe then it was in the times of greateſt ignorance, and blindeſt ſuperſtition: for then they thought they could not giue enough vnto their Maſſing Prieſt, and now they thinke they cannot pull enough away from the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Miniſter; then they thought euery peny better beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then other vpon their Confeſſor, now they thinke euery peny worſe beſtowed then other vpon their Paſtor. But it is
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:599:267"/> no new thing to ſee blinde deuotion ſometimes to carry men further then doth ſound and ſincere religion.

And ſo it falleth out very often, that in time of darkneſſe and ignorance men are more enflamed towards the Church and Paſtors thereof, with a blinde zeale, then with a true zeale in the cleere light of the Goſpell. Well, let vs know that wee are to giue vnto them that labour amongſt vs, and watch ouer our ſoules, that which is due vnto them, whether it be of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their liuelihood, or of reuerence vnto their perſons.

                  <p>Againe, hee calleth him his fellow-ſouldier. What then? <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> were they ſouldiers? Went they forth to battell? Were not the Leuites, and are not the Miniſters of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus exempted from ſeruice in warre? Is the Miniſter to labour like an husbandman, and beſides al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to fight as a ſouldier? Yea certainly, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> were fellow-ſouldiers: neither are any of the Miniſters of Chriſt exempted from warre, but fight they muſt, and ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they muſt be. But neither are their weapons carnall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they muſt fight, neither are the enemies againſt which they muſt fight ſo much fleſh and bloud, as ſpirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and the princes of the darkneſſe of this world. They are ſouldiers to fight with the ſword of the ſpirit againſt euery high thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:599:267"/> God, and to bring into captiuitie euery thought to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt. In this then that the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> his fellow-ſouldier, wee are put in minde as of the ſtate of all Chriſtians in generall, ſo of the Miniſters of the Goſpell in particular, namely that the life of all Chriſtians in generall, and of the Miniſters of the Goſpell in particular, is nothing elſe but a continuall warfare, wherein wee muſt ſtill play the ſouldiers, and ſtill fight. We looke for a Citie where there ſhall be no more death, no more ſorrow, no more crying, no more paine, neither any enemies to fight withall, where wee ſhall triumph ouer euery enemie that hath exalted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt vs, and where wee ſhall raigne and euer bee with the Lord in the kingdome of Chriſt Ieſus for euer and euer. But whiles wee are members of the militant Church here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, no man better or worſe, rich or poore, may promiſe reſt vnto himſelfe, but all muſt ſtand vpon their guard, and all muſt alwayes be in a readineſſe to fight.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 7.1.</note> Whereupon <hi>Iob</hi> calleth the life of man a warfare, becauſe together with his life his warfare ſhall only haue an end. And our Sauiour telleth vs, that the day hath enough with his owne griefe, that is,<note place="margin">

Now the enemies which wee haue to fight withall, are the world without vs, the fleſh within vs, and the deuill ſeeking continually like a roaring Lion to deuoure vs; none of all which want either will, or skill, or might to ouerthrow vs, vnleſſe wee hold faſt the reioycing of our hope vnto the end. The fleſh hath ſo many ſugred baits and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full delights to allure men vnto the enticements thereof, that ſometimes <hi>Dauids,</hi> and <hi>Salomons,</hi> and men after Gods owne heart, cannot auoid the ſnares thereof, but are entangled therewith. The world likewiſe hath ſo many wayes to deceiue, as that euen the Diſciples of Chriſt Ieſus cannot auoid it, but be deceiued thereby. And the deuill ſo furiouſly rageth, as that the Sonne of God Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe cannot auoid his manifold tentations. Theſe are thoſe enemies which we haue all of vs to fight withall, and theſe wee ſhall haue to fight withall ſo long as wee liue in this fleſh, and whatſoeuer batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie any of theſe or all theſe can lay againſt our ſoules wee ſhall

The deuill likewiſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth continually like a roaring Lion whom he may deuoure.

                  <p>And as this is the ſtate of all Chriſtians in generall, to liue in continuall fight againſt their ſpirituall enemies, ſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in particular hath a chiefe part in this fight. I will not ſtand to enlarge this point. The deuill knoweth that if the ſhepheard can bee turned out of the way, his ſheepe will quickly be ſcattered; and if hee can make the Angell of the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> to be neither hot nor cold, hee will quickly bring the Church vnto his bent. And therefore hee bends his full force againſt them, arming both the fleſh, and the world, and himſelfe againſt them, to ſee if hee can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, euen as he did againſt Chriſt, deſirous to breake the head, whereas his power was limited onely to bruiſe the heele.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſhould this teach vs? Surely firſt it ſhould teach vs this leſſon, that ſince wee haue ſuch enemies continually to deale withall, therfore we ſhould put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to reſiſt in the euill day, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing finiſhed all things, ſtand faſt: for ſo the Apoſtle teacheth vs in the laſt to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where hauing ſet downe what enemies we haue to wreſtle againſt, as againſt principalities, againſt powers,<note place="margin">

This is that armour which the Apoſtle preſcribeth vs both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelues, and to offend our enemies withall; and this armour if wee put on, wee ſhall be able to ſtand againſt all the aſſaults of the deuill, for here is armour for the whole body, from the head to the foot, vnleſſe wee will turne our backe vpon our enemie.</p>
                  <p>Now conſider this, men and brethren, and lay it vnto your hearts.

If either yee want your helmet and head peece, which is the hope of ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt, or if yee want your breſt-plate, which is righteouſneſſe and innocencie of life, or if yee want the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of life, or if yee want the girdle of your loynes, which is veritie and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in religion, or if yee want your ſhooes, which is a minde prepared and ready to embrace the Goſpell of peace, or if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all theſe things, yee be fainting and failing in praier and ſupplication in the ſpirit, in ſuch parts as theſe are wanting, one or moe, yee are diſarmed, and lie open vnto euery ſtroke of that enemie which woundeth deadly, and euery of whoſe venewes are as ſo many ſtings of death.

Yee muſt not turne your backe and flie from him: for hauing no armour, as euen now I told you, for your backe parts, if ye flie, he followes, and ſtrikes, and wounds deadly, becauſe there is no armour to keepe backe the force of his ſtroke. If yee will put him to flight, yee muſt ſtand to him, and reſiſt him. Now your reſiſtance muſt be by putting on this armour of God; and if the whole armour be not put on, the enemie quickly eſpies his aduantage, and there aſſaults where any part of the armour wants. Now will yee know whither to come for this armour of God, and where to haue it? Come to the word of God, and the Goſpell of peace, there ſhall yee haue it, and there ſhall ye learne ſo to put it on, that the enemie, would he neuer ſo faine, yet ſhall not be able to hurt you. This is that word, vnto the reuerent hearing and embracing whereof I doe often exhort you, neither can I euer too much exhort you. And now againe I tell you, that if yee will ſtand faſt in the euill day, if yee will be ſafe from ſuch enemies as wound the ſoule deadly, if yee will as good ſouldiers ſo fight that yee will neuer flie, then muſt yee let the word of the Lord dwell in you plentifully: for ſo, and ſo onely, yee ſhall bee mightie through God to caſt downe holds, and euery thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt God, whether it bee the luſt of the fleſh, or the luſt of the eyes, or the pride of life, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer other thing elſe of the world it be.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond leſſon which this ſhould teach vs, is, that if our whole life bee nothing elſe but a continuall warfare againſt ſuch mortall enemies, then ſhould wee deſire to be diſſolued and to bee with Chriſt, rather then to continue ſtill in ſuch a vale of miſerie, where there is continuall fighting. After a ſore and ſharpe fight at Sea, or at Land, continued by the ſpace of ſeuen or eight houres, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily a whole day together, would wee blame them if then they did deſire reſt, or rather would wee not maruell at them if then they ſhould not deſire reſt? Now the fight which wee maintaine againſt our ſpirituall enemies, is not onely for the ſpace of certaine houres, or dayes, but for dayes and nights, euen for the whole tearme and courſe of
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:599:269"/> our life. Should it not then ſeeme a thing maruellous and ſtrange, that wee ſhould not deſire peace and to haue our warfare at an end? Yet who is he that is not loth to lay downe his houſe of clay? Who is hee almoſt, that when death knockes at his doore, would not liue a little longer if hee might? Yet let mee not here be miſtaken: for I doe not ſay this as if I liked of this, that men ſhould deſire to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the bonds of this life before the time appointed of the Lord come. Nay let the children of God ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto his will, who will diſlodge them when it ſeemeth beſt to his godly wiſdome; and in the meane time let them this know, and therein comfort themſelues, that howſoeuer their fight bee long and great, yet that the Lord hath ſo done with their enemies, as <hi>Iudah</hi> dealt with <hi>Adonibezek,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Judg.</hi> 1.6.</note> euen cut off the thumbes of their hands and feet, that is, ſo abated their power, and broken their ſtrength, that though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually aſſault them, yet can they neuer preuaile againſt them. This therefore I doe not ſay as if I liked that any ſhould deſire to die before his time appointed of the Lord come, but rather to leſſon vs in this, that when our glaſſe is runne, and our time appointed of the Lord come, we ſhould not then be vnwilling to lay downe our liues, but rather bee then glad and reioyce that our warfare is at an end, and that wee ſhall be ioyned with our head Chriſt Ieſus. A man would thinke wee ſhould greatly deſire to be deliuered from theſe miſeries whereunto this life is ſubiect, rather to triumph ouer our enemies, then to liue ſtill at the ſtaues end with them; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raigne with Chriſt in the valley of bleſſing, where there is peace, and ioy, and life for euermore, then to fight vnder Chriſt in the valley of teares, where hee ſhall beare away many ſtrokes, though not any deadly wounds, becauſe his life is hid with Chriſt in God. What then ſhould bee the cauſe why wee ſhould not moſt willingly lay downe our liues in the time of death? Surely in my iudgement it is becauſe in the time of our health wee minde too much earthly things, and ſet our affections too little on the things that are aboue. For if in the time of our health our conuerſation were in heauen, as it ſhould bee, wee would
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:599:270"/> moſt patiently and willingly looke for the Sauiour, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile bodie that it may be faſhioned like vnto his glorious bodie, and when death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched we would cry with the Apoſtle, <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come quickly.</hi> To conclude this point therefore when our time appointed of the Lord comes, let vs willingly lay downe our liues, and let vs be glad and reioyce that our warfare is at an end. And to the end that in the time of death we may do ſo, let our conuerſation in the meane time, in the time of health be in heauen; let vs ſet our affections on the things that are aboue, and not on the things which are on the earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For he longed after all you &amp;c.]</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle ſetteth downe the cauſe why he now preſently ſent <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and did not ſtay him till either <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> or himſelfe ſhould come vnto them. The cauſe was (as appeareth by the Apoſtle) becauſe <hi>Epaphroditus greatly lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> it is not ſaid after his owne people, and them of his owne familie, but becauſe he longed after the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> neither ſo onely, but after all the Church at <hi>Philippi;</hi> neither did he onely long after them all, but ſo he longed that he was full of heauineſſe till he might come vnto them. And why did he ſo long after them that he was full of heauineſſe till he might come vnto them? The Apoſtle ſaith, becauſe the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> had heard of his ſickneſſe. <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> then longed after all the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and was full of heauineſſe till he might come vnto them, and therefore the Apoſtle ſent him preſently vnto them; and againe, <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> knew that the <hi>Philippians</hi> had heard of his ſicknes, and therefore he lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged after them all, and was full of heauineſſe till he might come vnto them. To knit vp then both the cauſes in one, and to gather the ſumme of all, the cauſe why the Apoſtle ſent <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> now preſently vnto them, was becauſe <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> hauing heard that the <hi>Philippians</hi> knew of his ſickneſſe, longed greatly after them all, and was full of heauineſſe till he might come vnto them, and comfort them ouer his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, leſt they ſhould be ſwallowed vp of too much griefe for both <hi>Pauls</hi> bands, and his ſicknes.</p>
                  <p>Here then I note what mutuall loue and affection there
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:599:270"/> ſhould be betweene the Paſtor, and his people, euen the like that was betweene <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> and his people of <hi>Philippi.</hi> The Paſtor his ſicknes or ſorrow whatſoeuer ſhould be the peoples ſorrow and heauineſſe of heart: and againe, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples trouble of minde or affliction of bodie ſhould be the Paſtors anguiſh of ſoule, and vexation of ſpirit. So it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> and his Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> as here we ſee: and ſo it was betweene <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the Churches, at leaſt on his part, as himſelfe witneſſeth, ſaying, that ſuch was his care of all the Churches,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</note> that <hi>if any were weake he was alſo weake, and if any were offended he alſo burned.</hi> And I wiſh I could truely inſtance in the like affection betweene many Paſtors and their people in this our day. But ſuch examples are not euery where with vs: nay in too many places with vs the Paſtor cares not if he may haue their fleece, though hee neuer ſee or heare of his people and flocke: and againe in too many places the people care not, if they may haue their forth in their owne delights, and deſires, though they neuer ſee or heare of their Paſtor. Yea ſo farre are they from this ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and mutuall loue and affection one towards another, that ſo the one may haue his profit, and the other their pleaſure, they are not much touched without any further reſpect either of other. Well, it ſhould not be ſo, but the ioy of the one ſhould be the ioy of the other, and the griefe of the one ſhould be the griefe of the other.</p>
                  <p>Now here happily it may be demanded, why either <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> or the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould be ſo full of heauineſſe, and take the matter ſo much to heart, ſeeing his ſicknes, which was the cauſe of all this heauineſſe, came vnto him by the will of God, and his gracious prouidence. Whereunto in one word I anſwer, that this mutuall heauineſſe one for another was onely an argument of their mutuall loue one of another, not any argument of their ignorance or doubt of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence in his ſickneſſe. Our Sauiour Chriſt, as we read, <hi>gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſpirit,</hi> and was troubled in himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.33.</note> and wept for the death of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> This ſhewed his great loue of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as the <hi>Iewes</hi> very well gathered, ſaying, <hi>behold how he loued him:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">36.</note> but will any man gather hence that he knew not or doubted
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:599:271"/> of Gods prouidence in his death? Nay himſelfe plainely ſaid in the beginning of that chapter, that <hi>that ſicknes was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, but for the glory of God, that the ſonne of God might be glorified thereby.</hi> So that albeit he knew that his death was by Gods prouidence, God ſo prouiding that his Sonne might thereby be glorified, yet ſuch was his loue towards him that he wept, and was much troubled for him. Well then <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> and the <hi>Philippians</hi> might be full of heauineſſe each for other, in regard of that loue and tender affection which they had each to other, and yet might they well both acknowledge the prouidence of God in his ſickneſſe, which was the cauſe of heauineſſe each in other. To the point in generall in one word I ſay, that in that loue which we beare, and ought to beare one towards another we may be ſorry one for the things that befall vnto another, albeit we know certainely of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of Almighty God therein: yet ſo in loue one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another we muſt be ſorrowfull one for another, that our faith in Gods prouidence muſt ſtint our ſorrow that it be not exceeding ſorrowfull, becauſe we know that all things worke for the beſt for Gods children.</p>

Let vs therefore now ſee what notes and obſeruations we may gather hence, whereof wee may make ſome vſe vnto our ſelues.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here we ſee that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> a faithfull ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, a painefull Miniſter of the Church, one whom the holy Apoſtle made that reckoning of that hee called him his brother, his companion in labour, his fellow-ſouldier, was ſick, and that very ſore ſicke. Whence I gather this obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the children of God, and moſt faithfull ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt are ſubiect, as vnto many miſeries, and troubles, and infirmities of this life, ſo vnto ſickneſſe and diſeaſes of the body. How faithfull a ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt <hi>Timothy</hi> was ye heard a little before vpon occaſion of the Apoſtle his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſend him vnto the <hi>Philippians verſ.</hi> 19. And how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect he was vnto ſickneſſe may appeare by that aduiſe which the Apoſtle giueth vnto him in his former Epiſtle vnto him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23.</note> where he aduiſeth him to drinke no longer water, but to vſe a little wine for his ſtomachs ſake, and for his often infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his ſickneſſe likewiſe ye ſee how plaine teſtimonie the Apoſtle giueth in this place. Nay what childe of God freed or exempted from bearing of this croſſe, and drinking of this cuppe? What ſhall wee ſay then? Are not ſickneſſes and diſeaſes of the body the rodde of Gods wrath a herewithall he doth puniſh the ſinne and rebellion of the wicked? Or doth the Lord lay the rodde of his wrath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:599:272"/> he puniſheth the wicked, vpon his owne children and faithfull ſeruants? True it is, that ſickneſſe and diſeaſes of the body are the rodde of Gods wrath wherewith hee puniſheth the diſobedience and rebellion of the wicked, as the Scriptures plainely proue vnto vs. Let that one place in <hi>Deuterenomie</hi> ſerue for all the reſt; where the Lord hauing made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of bleſſings vnto them that obey his commandements, afterward threatneth curſes and plagues vnto them that will not obey his voice, and keepe his commandements. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other of thoſe plagues which the Lord would bring vpon them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.2.3.15.</note> it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord ſhall ſmite thee with a conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with the feauer, and with a burning ague, and with a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent heate &amp;c.</hi> Where ye ſee plainely that conſumptions, and feauers, and hot-burning agues, and ſuch like diſeaſes are reckoned among thoſe plagues and roddes of his wrath wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he puniſheth the ſinnes of that Land,<note place="margin">22</note> or that Countrie, or that towne, or that people whatſoeuer that wil not hearken vnto his voice, nor obey his commandements. And may we not iuſtly feare that the Lord hath taken this rodde into his hand, and already begunne to puniſh vs therewith? Looke vnto the diſobedience, and rebellion, and neglect of walking in the waies of Gods commaundements that is generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, and ſee whether wee haue not giuen him cauſe to take this rodde, and to puniſh vs therewith? Againe, looke vnto ſuch hot agues, vnto ſuch ſharpe, and ſtrange, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilentiall diſeaſes and ſickneſſes as are now generally amongſt vs, and ſee whether hee haue not begunne to doe with vs as he threatned in his law? Surely for our ſinnes, euen becauſe wee haue not obeyed his voice, and done after his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he hath taken his rodde, and already begunne thus to puniſh vs therewith. And this rodde of his wrath, as wee our ſelues may ſee, he doth lay euen vpon his owne children, and faithfull ſeruants aſwell as hee doth vpon the wicked and vngodly of the earth: but yet with this difference. Vpon the vngodly he layeth this rodde of his wrath, in wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to render vnto them according to the wickedneſſe of their waies: the ſame rodde alſo he laieth vpon his children, not in wrath, but in loue to reforme them and to reclaime
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:599:272"/> them from the wickedneſſe of their waies. Vpon the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he layeth this rodde and the ſtroke thereof enrageth them againſt God, ſo that in their ſickneſſe they are not onely with out all comfort and patience, but like vnto curſed <hi>Caine</hi> they crie, my ſickeneſſe is greater then I am able to beare, why am I thus, what a ſeuere iudge is this that lieth his hand ſo heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon me; the ſame rodde alſo hee lieth vpon his children, but he giueth them patience vnder the rodde, and ſtrength to beare whatſoeuer he laieth vpon them, ſo that in their ſicknes they are comfortable both in themſelues, and vnto others. So that albeit the ſame rodde lye vpon both, yet doth God lay it vpon them with great difference. Which yet will better and more plainely appeare vnto vs if wee ſhall briefly touch ſome of thoſe reaſons why he lieth this rodde vpon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, why his children are viſited with ſickneſſe. One reaſon is, as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.</note> 
                     <hi>that being chaſtened of the Lord they may not be condemned with the world.</hi> For ſuch is the louing mercy of the Lord towards his children, that when they haue either omitted ſome ſuch dutie as they ought to haue performed, or committed ſome ſuch ſinne as they ought not to haue done, he as a louing father towards his tender childe whom hee dearely loueth, correcteth and chaſtiſeth them with the rodde of ſickneſſe, or weakneſſe, or ſome ſuch like rodde, that ſo they may ſee their owne error and be healed. <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>many are weake and ſicke among you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">30.</note> 
                     <hi>and many ſleepe.</hi> For this cauſe: for what cauſe? euen for not diſcerning the Lord his body in comming vnto the communion of the body and bloud of Chriſt. In which place the Apoſtle plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, that therefore many of Gods children are weake, and ſicke, and die, euen becauſe they doe not duely and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examine themſelues before they come vnto the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lord his ſupper. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>when wee are iudged and puniſhed, wee are chaſtened of the Lord as children of their father, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world, euen with the wicked men of the world, whoſe portion is in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for euer.</hi> Sometimes then Gods children are ſicke, that ſo their error, or their negligence, or their wickedneſſe may be reformed, and they brought into
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:599:273"/> the right way wherein they ſhould walke. Another reaſon is, that ſo they may be ſtaied from ſuch inordinate waies as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto naturally they are bent, and wherein ſometimes they would walke if they were not holden backe as with a bridle. For whoſe delight in the waies of the Lord is ſo entire and ſo altogether vncorrupt before him. That hee maketh, as he ſhould do, his law his whole delight, and his councellour? Nay whoſe pathes are ſo ſtraight that hee hath not an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening delight in ſome crooked by-pathes? or whoſe will and deſire, and affections are ſo ſanctified that they are not often enclined, and ſometimes caried as it were with a maine ſtreame vnto that which is euill? And therefore the Lord on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe knowing beſt what is beſt for his children, ſometimes viſiteth them with ſickeneſſe, that ſo being exerciſed with his rodde they may not runne into ſuch danger of body and ſoule as otherwiſe they would. A third reaſon why the children of God are ſicke ſometimes is, that thereby he may make triall of their faith, and of their patience, to ſee whether they can be conrent as to receiue health, ſo to receiue ſicknes of the Lord, and whether as in health, ſo in ſickneſſe they will put their truſt in the Lord, and ſubmit themſelues vnto his will. For both health and ſickneſſe they are of the Lord, and both in health and in ſickneſſe wee ſhould put our truſt in the Lord, and ſubmit our ſelues vnto his will. Yet ſo choiſe wee are that we can be content to receiue health from the Lord, but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receiue ſickneſſe from the Lord, and ſo weake wee are euen the beſt of vs that howſoeuer wee doe in health, yet in ſickneſſe we can hardly ſubmit our ſelues vnto God his will, and oftentimes more put our truſt in Phiſitions then in the Lord,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 16.</note> as we read that that good King of <hi>Iudah Aſa</hi> did, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in declining from that right path wherein he ought to haue walked. Sometimes then as I ſay Gods children are ſicke that the Lord their God may ſo trie whether they will ſtill cleaue faſt vnto him, and patiently ſubmit themſelues vnto his will. A fourth reaſon why the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d ſometimes viſiteth his children with ſickneſſe is, that they alſo may haue a farther triall of the mercifull goodneſſe of the Lord towards them. For albeit his children are neuer without great experiences of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:599:273"/> goodneſſe towards them, yet wherein haue they greater experience thereof, and wherein their ſoule more to reioyce then that in the time of their ſickneſſe he aſſiſteth them with the comfort of his holy ſpirit, and giueth them ſtrength and patience to endure what he laieth vpon them, and ſuffereth not their faith, or their hope to faile, but ſo prepareth them vnto him, that come death, come life, they can willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace either, becauſe they know that come death, come life they are the Lords. An eſpeciall great goodneſſe of the Lord towards his children. Whereof they haue ſuch triall in time of their ſickneſſe as that thereby not themſelues alone, but ſuch as are about them are and may bee greatly comforted. And ſometimes no doubt they are ſicke that ſeeing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Lord towards them in time of their ſicknes; they may the rather praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and ſtudie to glorifie his name in the time of their health. Not to trouble you with moe reaſons hereof, the laſt reaſon why the Lord viſiteth his children with ſickneſſe is, to put them in minde both of that ſinne which dwelleth in them, and alſo of their mortalitie. For ſickneſſe is both the fruite of ſinne, and alſo the Harbinger of death. For howſoeuer ſinne be not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe wherefore ſickneſſe commeth, yet is it alwaies a cauſe wherefore it is ſent: inſomuch that we ſee when our Sauiour healed ſome that were ſicke, hee would ſay ſometimes vnto them, <hi>ſome be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 9 2.</note> In which ſpeach he gaue them this note, that ſinne was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe of their ſickneſſe: and ſometimes hee would ſay vnto them, <hi>Behold thou art made whole, ſinne no more, leaſt a worſe thing come vnto thee;</hi> wherein in effect he told them that their ſickneſſe was a chaſticement for their ſinne. And againe howſoeuer death doth not alwaies follow ſicknes, yet ought ſickneſſe alwaies to put vs in minde of our mortality. Well it may be that thoſe our houſes of clay which in this or that ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe threaten to fall, may for a time bee patched vp againe, yet they which threaten now to fall, at length ſhall fall, and downe to the ground they ſhall be brought. For as the Pſal miſt ſpeaketh, <hi>who liueth that ſhall not ſee death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſa.</hi> 89 47.</note> 
                     <hi>or who ſhall bee able to deliuer himſelfe from the hand of the graue?</hi> Of the duſt
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:599:274"/> of the earth we are, and to earth we ſhall returne; and ſo many ſickneſſes as we are viſited withall ſhould be vnto vs as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remembrances both of that ſinne which cleaueth ſo faſt vnto vs, and likewiſe of death which is the fruit thereof. Thus then ye ſee the reaſons why the Lord lieth this rodde of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vpon his owne children, namely, as a mercifull and louing father to reforme whatſoeuer error, negligence, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fault is in them, to keepe them backe as with a bridle from inordinate walking, to make triall of their faith, and patience, to giue them triall of his mercifull goodneſſe towards them, and to put them in minde of ſinne dwelling in them, and of their mortalitie. Wherby alſo ye may eaſily diſcerne in what a different ſort the Lord layeth on this rodde on the godly, and on the vngodly; on the one as a father, on the other as a iudge, on the one in loue, on the other in wrath, on the one to chaſtice and correct, on the other to puniſh and reuenge, on the one to reforme the wickedneſſe of their waies, on the other to recompence them their wickedneſſe, on the one to ſaue them from death and hell, on the other to bring them to the pit of deſtruction.</p>

And albeit thou maiſt ſeeme vnto thy ſelfe that thou art not priuiledged from the wicked and vngodly, becauſe thou drinkeſt of the cup of his wrath, becauſe thou art viſited with ſicknes as well as they, and perhaps more then they, yet plucke vp thine heart, be not diſcouraged, but be of good comfort. For hee doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee in his anger, neither doth hee chaſtice thee in his diſpleaſure: but as a mercifull and louing father, in tender loue and in great compaſſion by this his gentle hand and lou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing correction he calleth thee to remembrance of thy waies, and lets thee ſee what thou art, and whether thou muſt. Thy heart is not ſound and right with thy God, thou art negligent in doing of his will, thou haſt walked in ſome by-path where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:599:274"/> thou ſhouldeſt not haue walked; thus louingly and mildly he correcteth thee that thou maieſt reforme the wickedneſſe of thy waies, and there may be an healing of thine error. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, thou art walking where and whether thou ſhouldeſt not; thus he ſtaieth thee that thou runne not thy ſelfe vpon the rockes, and that thou make not ſhipwracke of faith and a goood conſcience. Againe, thus he trieth thee that thy faith and thy patience being tried thou maiſt be made like vnto pure and fine gold purified ſeuen times in the fire. Againe, thus he giueth thee full triall of his mercifull goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, comforting thee with the ioy of the holy Ghoſt in the bedde of thy ſickneſſe, giuing thee patience to endure his croſſe, confirming thy faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and aſſuring thee of the hope of thy ſaluation. Laſtly, thus he putteth thee in minde of thy ſelfe, that thou ſhouldeſt not forget thy God, or thy ſelfe, but remembring that thou art both ſinnefull, and mortall, ſhouldeſt ſhake of ſinne, and ſo number thy daies that thou mighteſt apply thine heart vnto wiſedome. O how ſhould not the remembrance of theſe things comfort thy ſoule when thou lieſt ſicke vpon thy bedde. Beloued in the time of health let vs thinke of theſe things, and in the day of ſickneſſe let vs not be diſcouraged. I haue ſtood the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon this point becauſe the time ſeemeth vnto me ſo to require. Many of our brethren the Lord hath already taken vnto himſelfe, many in many places are preſently ſicke, and ſharpely viſited, and when our turne ſhall be hee onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who maketh ſicke, &amp; reſtoreth vnto health. In the meane time, let our health be to the glory of his name, and in the time of ſickneſſe let vs comfort our ſelues with theſe things.</p>
                  <p>I might here note the time when the Lord lay this his rod of ſickneſſe vpon <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> which was euen when he was faithfully and painfully occupied in the worke of Chriſt, when he was carefully diſcharging the truſt repoſed in him by the Church of <hi>Philippie,</hi> when hee was miniſtring vnto the holy Apoſtle lying then in priſon ſuch things as he wanted. Let it not therefore ſeeme ſtrange vnto vs if when we are faithfully labouring in the workes of our calling, euen then the Lord ſtrike vs with any rodde, or viſit vs with ſickneſſe. Which
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:599:275"/> note I doe the rather now point at by the way, becauſe the manner of ſome is vpon ſuch occaſions to make wonderfull ill collections. As for example: the Preacher confuting a point of popiſh doctrine groweth to be ſo ſicke that he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to breake off, and to come downe before he can end the point. What is the collection? Did not ye ſee, ſay ſome that are popiſhly affected, how the Lord did euen controll his diſcourſe, and by his iudgement vpon him gaue ſentence on our ſide. Another example: the Iudge from his ſeate of iuſtice pronouncing ſentence againſt the wicked Traitor, or vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malefactor, preſently or quickly after falleth ſicke, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily not long after dieth. What is the collection? Thus ſay ſome, hath the Lord giuen iudgement vpon him for ſuch iudgement as he gaue againſt others? And thus becauſe their fooliſhneſſe cannot reach vnto the depth of Gods counſell and wiſedome in his viſitations, they condemne them whom the Lord hath not condemned, and iudge that as vnholy and ill, which the Lord approueth as holy and good. Whatſoeuer he doth is holy and good, and if he chaſtice vs with his rods euen then when wee are doing his will, who ſhall aske him a reaſon of that he doth? Let vs therefore learne to ſubmit our ſelues vnto the Lord, and let vs beware how we iudge of things according to our owne reaſon and imagination, leaſt happily we condemne that which the Lord hath not condemned. But my meaning was only to touch this by the way. Now a word of the extremity of his ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Very neere vnto death.]</hi> Here was the extremity of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> had beene ſicke, and ſo ſicke that hee was very neere vnto death, euen without all hope of recouerie of health in mans ſight and iudgement. Whence I note the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull counſell and wiſedome of our God, who oftentimes brings his children euen to the gates of hell, and thence calls them, to the pit of deſtruction, and thence fetches them to deaths doore, ſo that there is but a ſteppe betweene them and death, and thence deliuers them. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was caſt into the deepe dungeon, and his feete ſet faſt in the ſtockes, and thence the Lord deliuered him. <hi>Ionas</hi> was caſt into the ſea, and there the Lord kept him aliue. <hi>Daniel</hi> was throwne into the denne
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:599:275"/> of Lyons, and there the Lord reſcued him, and deliuered him from the teeth of the Lyons. The three children were caſt into the hot firie-furnace, and there God prouided for them that the fire had no power ouer them to burne no not an haire of their head. But moſt befitting our preſent purpoſe is the example of that good King <hi>Ezechias,</hi> who was ſo ſicke that all Phyſitions as we ſay in a caſe of extremitie gaue him ouer, and there was no hope of life: inſomuch that the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> came vnto him, and ſaid vnto him, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>put thine houſe in an order: for thou ſalt die and not liue.</hi> Here was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the like extremitie of ſickeneſſe that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was brought vnto. A ſtep onely betweene them and death, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no ſteppel, but they deliuered out of the iawes of death as a pray out of the teeth of the wilde beaſt, or as a bird out of the ſnare of the fouler. And this the Lord may ſeeme to doe for theſe cauſes amongſt many other. 1. Thereby to make his power more to be knowne amongſt the ſonnes of men. For what can more manifeſt the power of almighty God then to ſaue vs when the pit is now ready to ſhut her mouth vpon vs, and nothing but preſent death before vs? 2. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their thankefulneſſe who being brought vnto the gates of death are thence deliuered. For how much neerer they were vnto death, ſo much greater praiſes are due vnto him that hath deliuered them from death. 3. Thereby to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them for euer vnder his mightie hand by whom they yet liue, moue, and haue their being. For what ſhould more humble vs then plainely to ſee that it is no way in our ſelues, but in the Lord only to ſaue our life from death, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from the power of the graue?</p>
                  <p>Seeing then it pleaſeth the Lord oftentimes to bring euen his deareſt children, and choiſeſt ſeruants into ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as of other dangers, ſo of ſickneſſe, let vs take heed how we iudge them as plagued of God for their offences, becauſe they are ſo extreamly viſited. Yee know it was the great fault of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends that ſtill they vrged him that ſurely hee was a great and grieuous ſinner, a wicked and an vngodly man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord his hand was ſo heauie vpon him. Nay my brethren, though ſome of our brethren in theſe hot and
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:599:276"/> ſharpe diſeaſes through extremity of paine, or otherwiſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, ſhould ſomtimes breake out into impatient ſpeaches, yet let vs take heede how we iudge them as forſaken of the Lord, ye know the example of <hi>Iob,</hi> into what execrations, and words of impatiencie he brake out through that extremitie of griefe wherewith he was holden: who yet was a very choiſe ſeruant of the Lord, and whoſe patience is commended in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Againe, ſeeing it pleaſeth the Lord oftentimes to bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his deareſt children, and choiſeſt ſeruants into ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of ſickneſſe, let this be a comfort vnto vs in what extremitie of ſickneſſe ſo euer we ſhall be. For no new thing herein doth befall vs, but ſuch as oftentimes doth the deareſt children of God, and he which deliuered them from the hand of the graue when the pit had euen ſhut her mouth almoſt vpon them, will alſo deliuer vs if it ſhall be for his glory, and our good. Sickneſſe, and extremitie of ſickeneſſe all are of the Lord, and all for the beſt vnto his children. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all things that befall vs ſo ſubmit our ſelues vnto the will of the Lord, as that both in heart and voice we euer pray and ſay, <hi>thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen.</hi>

Yet I would not here be ſo miſtaken, as if I iudged that becauſe it is the Lord that healeth our infirmities, therefore in the bed of our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes we ſhould onely call vpon the Lord, and neglect the meanes ordeined for the recouerie of our health. For as he hath appointed the end, ſo hath he ordeined the meanes vnto the end: And albeit ſometimes he worke without meanes, and reſtore vnto health without any medicine or phyſicke at all, yet moſt ordinarily he worketh by meanes, and reſtoreth
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:599:277"/> vnto health by medicine and phyſicke. And therefore we are not at any time to neglect the meanes of phyſicke and ſuch like helps for the recouerie of our health, but rather we are to vſe them with all thankfulneſſe vnto the Lord for them, and with all praier and ſupplication in the ſpirit for his bleſſing vpon them. We ſee how that good King <hi>Ezechias,</hi> when it had beene told him of the Lord by the Prophet,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.5.6.</note> thus, <hi>Behold I haue healed thee, and the third day thou ſhalt goe vp to the houſe of the Lord, and I will adde vnto thy daies fifteene yeere;</hi> yet for all that,<note place="margin">7.</note> when the Prophet ſaid vnto him, <hi>take a lumpe of dried figs, and lay it vpon the boyle, and thou ſhalt recouer,</hi> he tooke it, and laid it on, and recouered. He might haue ſaid, hath the Lord ſpoken and will he not performe it? He hath promiſed me heal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h, and a lengthning of my daies for 15 yeeres; what neede I more then his word, what neede I any medicine, or preſcript from any Phyſician? But we ſee he vſed no ſuch ſpeech, but as it pleaſed the Lord to vſe theſe meanes in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to health, ſo he with all thankfulnes vſed the meanes, and was reſtored vnto health. Let vs therefore know that it is the Lord onely that deliuereth from death, and reſtoreth vnto life and health; and that this he doth ſometimes without meanes, and moſt commonly by meanes. Let vs therefore in the bed of our ſickneſſe call vpon the Lord, and let vs not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the meanes which he hath ordeined for the recouerie of our health. Let vs onely truſt in the Lord, and let vs know that if the meanes be helpfull vnto vs, it is becauſe of the Lord his bleſſing vpon them. He bleſſeth the meanes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are healed by the meanes, ſo that he healeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are healed.</p>
                  <p>Now what is the cauſe wherefore the Lord hauing viſited vs with ſickneſſe doth againe raiſe vs from the bed of our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and reſtore vs vnto health? This is not for any thing in our ſelues, but for his owne mercies ſake, as the Apoſtle plainely ſheweth when he ſaith, <hi>but God had mercy on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> for it is as if he had ſaid, but God for his mercies ſake reſtored him vnto health. Whence I gather this note, that reſtoring vnto health is a mercy of the Lord. Which is farther proued vnto vs by that ſong or pſalme of thankſgiuing, which <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi>
                     <pb n="531" facs="tcp:599:277"/> made after his reſtoring vnto health, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold for felicitie I had bitter griefe, but it was thy pleaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer my ſoule from the pit of corruption.</hi> It was thy pleaſure, or it was thy loue to deliuer my ſoule &amp;c, where that is aſcribed to Gods loue, whence his mercy floweth, which in our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is aſcribed vnto Gods mercy. So that reſtoring vnto health is a louing mercy of the Lord. What ſhall we ſay then? When wicked and vngodly men are reſtored vnto health, is this a louing mercy of the Lord towards them? Yes ſurely. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or albeit ſo their ſinne, and conſequently their iudgement be increaſed, yet this not comming from this mercy of length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their daies, but from their owne corrupt nature, we are to account that health, and life, and wealth, and whatſoeuer elſe they haue are temporall mercies of the Lord vpon them. Howbeit the mercies of the Lord in reſtoring his children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to health, and in reſtoring the wicked vnto health, are much different. His mercy wherein he reſtoreth the wicked vnto health, is a generall mercy whereby he taketh pitie vpon all men, proceeding from ſuch a loue as whereby he maketh his ſunne to ariſe on the euill, and the good, and ſendeth raine on the iuſt, and vniuſt. But his mercy wherein he reſtoreth his children vnto health is a ſpeciall mercy, whereby he taketh pitie vpon his children, proceeding from that loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he loueth vs in Chriſt Ieſus: by that the wicked are only reſtored vnto bodily health, by this the children of God are ſo reſtored vnto bodily health, that farther in ſoule they are more quickned then before: by that the iudgement of the wicked is increaſed, for that they abuſe their health, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in mercy they are reſtored, vnto the diſhonor of God; by this Gods name is more glorified in his children, for that they vſe their health, whereunto in mercy they are reſtored, to the praiſe of the glory of Gods grace. In a word, by that the wicked are made more inexcuſable, by this the children of God are made more fruitfull in good works, and more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Gods loue. Albeit then it be a mercy of the Lord both to the godly, and likewiſe to the vngodly that they are reſtored vnto health, for that the Lord might in iuſtice haue ſuffered his rod to lie longer vpon them, if he had dealt with
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:599:278"/> them in weight and meaſure; yet is it ſuch a ſpeciall mercy proceeding from ſuch a ſpeciall loue which hee vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth vnto his children in reſtoring them to health, as that the wicked and vngodly haue no part or portion at all therein.</p>
                  <p>Is it then ſuch a ſpeciall mercy vnto Gods children that they are reſtored vnto health? Were not death rather a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall mercy of the Lord vnto them? or had not death then beene a ſpeciall mercy unto <hi>Epaphroditus?</hi> Surely it cannot be denied, but that it is a ſpeciall mercy of the Lord vnto his children, if when he hath exerciſed them with his rod, and prepared them by ſickneſſe vnto himſelfe, he take them by death out of the miſeries of this life, and tranſlate them into the kingdome of his Sonne.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ap.</hi> 14.13.</note> 
                     <hi>For ſo ſaith the Spirit: Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord:</hi> and why? <hi>for they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi> They reſt from their labors. What is that? that is, by death they are deliuered and freed from ſuch griefes, and ſorowes, and labours, and troubles and reuilings, and perſecutions, and hatreds, and other mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold calamities wherevnto this life is ſubiect, yea &amp; from that grieuious yoke and heauie bondage of ſinne, which made the Apoſtle to crie,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>O wretched man that I am who ſhall deliuer mee from the bodie of this death?</hi> Againe, their works followe them. What is that?

<pb n="533" facs="tcp:599:278"/> life, and reſtoring vnto health is a ſpeciall mercy of the Lord vnto his children, becauſe ſo they are made farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his glory who hath reſtored them vnto health.

                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 38.18</note> whereas <hi>the graue cannot confeſſe the Lord, neither death can praiſe him, but the liuing, the liuing,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Ezechias, they confeſſe him, and ſing praiſes vnto his name:</hi> &amp; againe being reſtored vnto health, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Lord hath reſerued them for his farther glory to be manifeſted in them, or by them, and therefore their ſtudie and care is ſo to lead their liues, as that Gods name may be glorified in them, and by them. A good nature (yee know) reioyceth in euery opportunitie that is giuen him, whereby he may ſhew himſelfe thankfull and dutifull, though it be to his trouble and coſt. Euen ſo the children of God, though this life be full of trouble and griefe, yet when their health is reſtored and their daies lengthned, they reioyce in the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie that God hath giuen them to doe good in the Church, or in the common-weale, and are carefull therein to ſhew themſelues both thankfull and dutifull vnto their God. For anſwer then vnto the point, in man we are to conſider briefly theſe two things, the good of himſelfe, and the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto the glory of God. In reſpect of the good of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, death is a ſpeciall mercy of the Lord vnto euery childe of God, becauſe then they reſt from their labours, and their workes follow them. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>it is beſt of all to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.</note> But in reſpect of others and of the glory of God, it is a ſpeciall mercy of God vnto his children to be reſtored vnto health, becauſe ſo they are made farther inſtruments of his glory, and of the good either of Church, or of Common-wealth. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle addeth,<note place="margin">24.</note> 
                     <hi>neuertheleſſe to abide in the fleſh is more needfull for you.</hi> Albeit then death had been a ſpeciall mercy of the Lord vnto <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> in reſpect of the good of himſelfe, yet in reſpect of the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> it was a ſpeciall mercy of the Lord, as our Apoſtle here ſaith, that he was reſtored vnto health. Neither yet would I ſo here be vnderſtood, as if I
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:599:279"/> thought, or taught, that it is a ſpeciall mercy of the Lord vnto his children to be reſtored vnto health onely in reſpect of the good of others, and not at all in reſpect of the good of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: for albeit death bee ſo a ſpeciall mercy of God vnto them in reſpect of the good of themſelues, for that thereby they are freed from the troubles of this life, and receiued into euerlaſting ioy and bliſſe; yet is health alſo and life a ſpeciall mercy of the Lord vnto them, euen in reſpect of the good of themſelues, becauſe the oftener they paſſe through the fire, the more they are purified, and made the finer gold; the more they are boulted and ſifted, the finer flower they will be. Albeit therefore by life they haue moe troubles, yet becauſe by troubles they are made more glorious, therefore is life and reſtoring vnto health a ſpeciall mercy of God vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren, not only in reſpect of others good, but in reſpect alſo of the good of themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Are then both death and recouerie of health ſpeciall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Lord vnto his children? If then we be the children of God, let not our hearts be troubled nor feare in the bed of our ſickneſſe. If it pleaſe the Lord by death then to cut off our dayes, this let vs know, that in mercy towards vs he doth it, that ſo we may not ſee the euils that are to come, that ſo we may haue reſt from all our labours, and from all the troubles of this life, and that ſo wee may be euer with our head Chriſt Ieſus, and haue the full fruition of thoſe ioyes which eye hath not ſeene, neither eare hath heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man to thinke of. And againe, if it pleaſe the Lord to reſtore vs vnto health, let vs know that in mercy likewiſe he doth it, that ſo we may confeſſe his name, and ſing praiſes vnto him in the land of the liuing, that ſo wee may be further inſtruments of his glory in doing good vnto others, either in in the Church, or in the Common-wealth, and that ſo being further tried, wee may be further purified, to returne as fine gold out of the fire. Hath any of vs then cauſe to mourne for them that doe already ſleepe in the Lord? Let vs mourne, but not as men without hope: for the Lord hath had mercy on them, and in his mercy towards them hath deliuered them out of priſon into a moſt glorious libertie, and hath brought
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:599:279"/> them from a moſt troubleſome ſea of miſeries, vnto the moſt happy hauen of euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe. Againe, hath any of vs beene reſtored from ſickneſſe vnto health? Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Lord herein hath had mercy on vs, as hee had on <hi>Epaphroditus.</hi> For this mercy let vs ſhew our ſelues thankfull vnto the Lord, and our thankfulneſſe vnto the Lord let vs teſtifie vnto the world by walking worthy of this mercy. He hath reſerued vs vnto his further glory. Let vs glorifie God both in our bodies, and in our ſpirits, for they are Gods. Let vs be faithfully, and painfully, and carefully occupied in the workes of our calling, whatſoeuer it be, vnto the glory of our God. And in particular, as this time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as God hath had mercy on vs by reſtoring vs vnto health, and bringing vs from the gates almoſt of death vnto life, ſo let vs take pitie and compaſſion on our poore diſtreſſed brethren, and by our morſels of bread and other releefe, let vs ſaue their liues from death. As our liues were precious in Gods ſight, ſo let their liues be precious in our ſight, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily are as deare vnto God as wee are.

So likewiſe ſometimes he ſheweth mercy on the Paſtor, and from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe reſtoreth him to health for his peoples ſake, both that they may be kept ſafe from ſcattering by the Wolfe, and that
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:599:280"/> they may bee taught in the wayes of the Lord: and againe, ſometimes he ſheweth mercy on the people for their Paſtors ſake, leſt that puniſhment which ſhould iuſtly light vpon them ſhould bring too much ſorrow vpon him. So we reade that he ſhewed mercy vnto that good King <hi>Ezechias</hi> being ſicke vnto death,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.1.</note> in reſtoring him vnto health, neither vnto him alone,<note place="margin">7.</note> but euen therein likewiſe he ſhewed mercy vnto the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in that ſo he kept them for fifteene yeeres ſpace from ſuch manifold miſeries and corruptions in religion as afterwards followed in the raigne of <hi>Manaſſes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">21.2.</note> Thus the Lord rich in mercy, ſo ſhewes his mercies vnto his children, as that therein there is a bleſſing not to them alone, but to others alſo.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould teach vs thus much, that we ſhould not be too much puffed vp for whatſoeuer mercies the Lord vouchſafeth vnto vs, as if for our owne ſakes alone they were beſtowed vpon vs, but ſeeing therein the Lord alſo purpoſeth a bleſſing vnto others, our care ſhould be to vſe them to the benefit of others: our health to profit others, our wealth to doe good vnto others, our knowledge to inſtruct others, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer mercies we haue vnto the good of others.

How haue thoſe parents learned this leſſon, that neuer regard the godly education of their children? or thoſe children, that deſpiſe their fathers inſtruction, and forſake their mothers teaching? or thoſe Paſtors, that ſeldome or neuer looke vnto their ſheepe? or thoſe ſheepe, that will not heare the voice of their Paſtors? Certainly in men of all ſorts there is either
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:599:280"/> great ignorance, or great forgetfulneſſe, or great contempt of this inſtruction: for generally wee doe not vſe the mercies of God vpon vs vnto the benefit of others, but either we know not, or wee forget, or wee neglect ſo to vſe them, or wee doe abuſe them vnto the hurt of others. Well, let vs know that as this mercy was ſhewed on <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> not for his ſake onely, but for <hi>Pauls,</hi> leſt hee ſhould haue ſorrow vpon ſorrow, ſo whatſoeuer ſuch mercy is ſhewed on vs, it is not for our owne ſakes only, but for others alſo, that they may haue comfort and profit thereby, or otherwiſe leſt they ſhould ſome way be grieued and troubled. And therefore as the Lod hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed this or that mercy vpon vs, of health, or of wealth, or of wiſdome, or of knowledge, or the like, let vs vſe the ſame to the good and benefit of others, as our ſtate, or place, or calling doth require, and in any caſe let vs beware that wee abuſe them not vnto the hurt of others.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee wherein it was a mercy of God vpon <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was reſtored vnto health. The Apoſtle ſheweth it when he ſaith, <hi>leſt I ſhould haue &amp;c.</hi> Herein then was it a mercy of God on <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> died not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſickneſſe, becauſe ſo he ſhould haue had ſorrow vpon ſorrow, vnto his ſorrow by his own bands and impriſonment ſhould haue beene added another ſorrow for his death. God therefore had mercy on <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> and reſtored him vnto health, not for his owne ſake only, but for <hi>Pauls,</hi> leſt he ſhould haue ſorrow vpon ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>What then? Was <hi>Paul</hi> ſorrowfull for any thing that befell him, or that was likely to befall him? Did he not with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e whatſoeuer did or could befall him? Or could he be ſaid to beare that with patience for which he was ſorrowful? That <hi>Paul</hi> was ſorrowfull for many things, may and doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare euen by this one place. He was ſorrowfull for his owne bands and impriſonment; he was ſorrowfull to ſee <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and to heare the <hi>Philippians</hi> to be ſo full of heauineſſe: and if <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> had now died, his death would haue made him very ſorrowfull. All which notwithſtanding, he did with patience beare both his owne bands, and the heauineſſe of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and ſo would haue borne

And how is patience ſeene, but in moderating ſorrowes, and quietly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them, and whatſoeuer may cauſe them?</p>
                  <p>The note then is, that ſorrow and the like affections and paſſions of mindes are nothings vnbeſeeming Chriſtians, as ſome haue fooliſhly thought, but rather ſuch things as very well beſeeme them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.3.</note> It was prophecied of our Sauiour, that he ſhould be a man full of ſorrowes; and that he was ſo, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by his weeping ouer <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by his trouble in ſpirit at the death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and by many other things. Nay how ſhall wee call him a Chriſtian that hath ſhut vp all bowels of compaſſion, and is not touched with a fellow-feeling of his brethrens infirmities? Herein is a good point of true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that wee reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe, and that wee beare with patience our owne ſorrowes, and whatſoeuer loſſe or croſſe which may cauſe ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but was it not a fault for <hi>Paul</hi> to be ſorry for <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> his ſickneſſe? or ſhould it not haue beene a fault in him if he had beene ſorry for his death, ſeeing theſe things came and ſhould haue come by the will of God? No ſurely: both in him it was, and in all Chriſtians it is a Chriſtian thing to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the ſicke, and to be ſorry for their infirmities, and for their death. So was Chriſt, ſo were the Apoſtles, and ſo are all Chriſtians, and ought to be. For what other thing is this for them that be ſtrong and in health, then for the rich to giue vnto the poore, for the learned to inſtruct the ignorant, for the ſtrong to helpe the weake, &amp;c.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Th.</hi> 4.13.</note>Yea, but wee are forbidden to ſorrow for the dead: How then ſhould it not haue beene a fault in <hi>Paul</hi> to haue ſorrowed for <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his death? Sorrow for the dead is not there ſimply forbid, but ſuch ſorrow as they haue which haue no hope of the reſurrection of the dead, and of life euerlaſting after this life. They ſorrow immoderately, becauſe they
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:599:281"/> thinke that when death comes there is an end. Such immo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derate ſorrow for the dead is there forbid, leſt we ſhould ſeeme by our too much ſorrowing ſo to thinke of the dead as the Gentiles did. But a moderate ſorrow is neither there, nor elſewhere forbid, but rather commended vnto vs by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our holy Apoſtle. So that wee may ſorrow for the dead, if wee doe it moderately, and with ſubmiſſion vnto the will of the Lord, knowing that whatſoeuer he doth is good, and that all things worke together for the beſt vnto thoſe that loue and feare him.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but had not <hi>Paul</hi> the gift of healing? If then <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> his ſickneſſe or death were ſuch a matter of ſorrow vnto him, why did he not heale him? That <hi>Paul</hi> had the gift of healing appeareth by many places in the Acts, as where it is ſaid, that <hi>God wrought no ſmall miracles by the hands of Paul, ſo that from his body were brought vnto the ſicke kerchiefes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 19.11 12.28.8.9.</note> 
                     <hi>or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefes, and the diſeaſes departed from them.</hi> And againe, where it is ſaid that he healed the father of <hi>Publius,</hi> who lay ſicke of a feuer, and of a bloudie flix, and that he healed many which had diſeaſes in that Iland. Yet it is very like that hee could not heale <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> albeit no doubt he would gladly haue had him whole. And this is a plaine proofe vnto vs, that the Apoſtles healed ſickneſſes and wrought other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, not by any vertue or power of their owne, but by the power of God; not whenſoeuer they would themſelues, but when it pleaſed the Lord they ſhould: as alſo it is ſaid in the Acts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 5.12.</note> that God wrought many ſignes and wonders by the hands of the Apoſtles. Being therefore onely Gods inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to heale diſeaſes, and to worke miracles, neither our Apoſtle, nor any of the reſt, could whenſoeuer they would doe theſe things, but only when he would whoſe inſtruments they were.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſent him therefore, &amp;c.]</hi> The firſt cauſe why hee preſently ſent him vnto them, was (as we haue heard) becauſe of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> himſelfe, becauſe hee ſo longed after them, that hee was full of heauineſſe till he might ſee them, as verſe 26. Other two cauſes of ſuch preſent ſending him vnto them are mentioned in this verſe in the words now read vnto you: The one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they when they ſhould ſee their Miniſter againe might reioyce, in theſe words, <hi>that when yee ſhould ſee him againe, &amp;c.</hi> The other, becauſe of the Apoſtle himſelfe, that hee might be the leſſe ſorrowfull, when they ſhould haue cauſe to reioyce by his preſence with them, in theſe words, <hi>and I might be the leſſe ſorrowfull.</hi> The words, ye ſee, are inferred by way of concluſion, <hi>I ſent him therefore, &amp;c.</hi> Where it is to be noted, that whereas before hee had ſaid, <hi>I thought it neceſſary to ſend him vnto you,</hi> now hee addeth a note of diligence and ſpeed which hee vſed herein, ſaying, <hi>I ſent him therefore the more diligently.</hi> And wherefore did he vſe ſuch diligence and ſpeed in ſending him? That is ſignified in the next words, to haue beene partly in behalfe of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that when they ſhould ſee him againe they might reioyce that he had ſo well recouered his health, and that now they might haue the fruit of his labours amongſt them; and partly in behalfe of himſelfe, that hee might be the leſſe ſorrowfull. Whereby the Apoſtle ſignifieth, that albeit hee ſhall not bee quite without ſorrow when they ſhall haue cauſe to reioyce
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:599:282"/> in <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his preſence, becauſe there were many things beſides which gaue him cauſe of ſorrow, yet he ſhall be much leſſe ſorrowfull, becauſe he ſhall be eaſed of that ſorrow which he conceiued vpon <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his ſickneſſe, and vpon their heauineſſe for his ſickneſſe. Now before we proceede farther, let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence for our vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſent him therefore the more diligently]</hi> In theſe words I note the diligence and carefulneſſe, and ſpeede which the Apoſtle vſed in ſending <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding himſelfe at this time had ſo great vſe of him as that almoſt he could not be without him. For the Apoſtle lying now in priſon where <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> miniſtred vnto him ſuch things as he wanted, it could not be but he muſt needes haue great vſe of him. Yet when the Apoſtle heard that they were ſo full of heauineſſe for his ſickneſſe, and that they greatly deſired to ſee him, he ſlacked no diligence, neither vſed any delay, but with what diligence and with what ſpeede he could he ſent him vnto them. Whence I obſerue the nature and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a faithfull friend, which is not to delay the time, but whatſoeuer excuſe elſe we might make, with all diligence to gratifie our friend when his neede doth require. For as cheerefulneſſe and willingneſſe, ſo carefullneſſe and readineſſe then to pleaſure when neede doth require are very requiſite in the performance of euery dutie of one friend vnto another. Yea but where ſhall a man finde ſuch a friend, as without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, when neede doth require, will doe the duety of a friend, when he might haue happily iuſt excuſe to the contrary?

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:599:283"/> faith, and there ſhalt thou finde ſuch a friend as now we ſpeake of; ioyne thy ſelfe vnto them in whom there is religion and the true feare of God, and in them thou ſhalt finde that which thy ſoule deſireth. Others can and will make as faire a ſhew oftentimes as the beſt, and yet faile thee happily then when thou moſt needeſt them. Euery litle pretence will ſerue them for excuſe good enough; but if they can haue ſuch an excuſe as here <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle might haue had, though thou ſtand in as much need of helpe, as here the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſtood of com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort, hope thou maieſt, but helpe thou ſhalt finde none. But they that are ioyned vnto thee in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit, they that are linked vnto thee in that beſt bond of loue, the feare of the Lord, they will not faile thee in the needfull time of trouble, they will not ſhift thee of for this &amp; that time with this or that excuſe, but with all diligence, and with all ſpeede they will be ready to helpe thee, and to comfort thee as thy neede doth require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for indeede ſinceritie in religion, and the true feare of the Lord, are the beſt bands of chriſtian friendſhip. We read in profane ſtories of ſome much renowned for moſt rare friendſhip. But what elſe were thoſe but as ſhadowes in reſpect of the bodie? What friendſhip of theirs came euer neere vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to that of <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1.</note> whoſe ſoules were ſo knit ei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther vnto other as that either loued other as his owne ſoule? Who more faithfull vnto any then <hi>Huſhai</hi> the <hi>Archite</hi> vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam</hi> 15.</note> at whoſe requeſt he tooke (as we ſay) his life in his hand, and vndertooke with all diligence and ſpeed to bring to nought the counſell of <hi>Ahitophel?</hi> Yea generally where religion and the feare of the Lord knits the knot, there the friendſhip is moſt ſure, and the duties thereof beſt performed. If therefore thou wilt haue ſuch a friend, as without delay (when neede doth require) will doe the dutie of a friend, and not ſhift thee of for this &amp; that time with this and that excuſe, ioyne thy ſelfe vnto him that is religious &amp; feareth the Lord, and let your loue be in the Lord, and for the Lord. For what is the cauſe wherefore friendſhip is ſo rare, and why there is ſuch ſlacknes in all ſorts of men to helpe one another, and to comfort one another in any time of neede? Surely hence, euen becauſe our loue is onely a cold loue grounded on this
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:599:283"/> or that worldly reſpect, but wee doe not loue one another in the Lord, and for the Lord, becauſe our ſoule delighteth in them that feare the Lord. O let all of vs delight in them that feare the Lord, and then will we, no doubt, as <hi>Pauls</hi> ſcholers, be diligent one vnto anothers good, and one vnto anothers comfort in euery time of need.</p>
                  <p>It followeth, <hi>that when ye ſhould ſee him againe, yee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce]</hi> In theſe wordes the Apoſtle ſetteth downe a ſecond cauſe and reaſon, wherefore hee ſent <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> with ſuch diligence and ſpeede. The cauſe was, as here it is ſignified, that after ſuch ſorow and heauineſſe of heart as they were filled with vpon the hearing of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters dangerous ſickneſſe, thinking they ſhould neuer ſee him againe, they might reioyce when they ſhould ſee him againe throughly well in health, &amp; able to doe the worke of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie. Here then we ſee how a faithfull friend is eſpecially to employ his diligence and his carefulneſſe, namely, as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters moſt needfull, ſo in them to the beſt purpoſe hee can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. A notable patterne whereof we haue in this example of our Apoſtle. The <hi>Philippians</hi> were at this preſent full of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe and ſorow, as we haue heard, for their Miniſters ſicke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe, and they much needed to be cheered and comforted. The Apoſtle he vſed all diligence, and after hee heard and knew of it, he delaied not the time to cheere them, and to comfort them. But how? hee might haue written his letters vnto them, and therein ſignified their Miniſters recouerie of his health, and ſo haue cheered and comforted them. But becauſe he thought neither meſſenger, nor letters, nor any thing elſe would ſo much reioyce them as his preſence with them, and the ſight of him, becauſe they thought they ſhould neuer haue ſent him againe, therefore hee ſent himſelfe vnto them, that when they ſhould ſee him againe they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, ſo taking the beſt courſe that hee could deuiſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them. So we ſee in the example of <hi>Huſhai</hi> before men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: when <hi>Dauid</hi> was in great diſtreſſe by <hi>Abſolon</hi> his ſonne <hi>Huſhai</hi> came vnto him with purpoſe to go with him,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32.34.</note> and in life or death not to leaue him. But when it was thought that his friendſhippe would be to better purpoſe vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> if
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:599:284"/> he ſhould returne vnto the Citie, and bring the counſell of <hi>Ahitophel</hi> to nought, he did that which was thought would be to the beſt purpoſe Right ſo, if wee will approue our ſelues faithfull friends indeed, as we muſt employ all diligence and carefulneſſe in matters moſt needfull for our friend, ſo muſt we do it to the beſt purpoſe wee can deuiſe. For albeit dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gence and carefulneſſe in euery matter of our friend be very commendable in vs, yet is it then worthily moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when it is imployed to the beſt purpoſe; 1. When our care is ſpecially bent to that which apparantly may be to our friends greateſt good and comfort. A matter of too too rare practiſe. Few carefull of others good, and of thoſe few that will ſeeme ſometimes to be carefull, very few that will care for them in things moſt needfull, and feweſt of all that will in ſuch ſort care for them in things needfull, as may be moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull for them. If the courſe moſt behouefull for our friend be ſomewhat hurtfull for our ſelues, wee will rather thinke of ſome other courſe then that whereby wee may ſo helpe our freind as that withall wee may not hurt our ſelues: And ſo that wee ſhew our ſelues friends wee thinke it is well though we doe not ſo much as we ſhould. Well, I wiſh wee would thinke of this example of our holy Apoſtle, and as he was moſt diligent and carefull not onely to comfort the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> but in ſuch ſort to comfort them as they moſt deſired; ſo we would be diligent and carefull both to doe good vnto others, and that likewiſe in ſuch ſort as they thereby might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the greateſt good, though happily our ſelues ſhould be ſomwhat endamaged thereby.</p>
                  <p>What then? happily you will ſay vnto mee, was it ſuch a commendable matter in the Apoſtle to ſend their Miniſter backe againe vnto them? or was it ſuch a pleaſure vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> to ſee their Miniſter againe? It may be that ſome would ſtand at an anſwer to theſe queſtions in particular, who ſhew but too plainely by their practiſe what they thinke or theſe queſtions in the generall. For touching the Miniſters in generall, who is he that if his Miniſter be abſent from his Church greatly longeth after him? who is hee that if his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be ſicke vnto death greatly wiſheth his reſtoring vnto
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:599:284"/> health? who is he that if his Miniſter be abſent and ſick feares that he ſhall neuer ſee him againe? or who is he that will take ſuch a pleaſure and ioy of heart in it if he ſhall ſee him again? Some ſuch, God be thanked, there are, and God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake encreaſe the number of them, and his graces in them. But generally if the Miniſter be ſuch a one as makes a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his waies amongſt them, as carefully feedes them with the bread of life, and painefully leades them forth beſides the waters of comfort, ſuch a one as will religiouſly call them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſanctification of the Lord his Sabboth, and reſtraine them of their meriment, and ſports, and pleaſures, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton dalliances, ſuch a one as will ſharpely reproue their ſins, boldly put them in minde of their duties, and carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them from ſuch inordinate waies as they walke in, ſuch a one as we may very well preſume this <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was; if the Miniſter, I ſay, be ſuch a one, generally wee long not for his preſence if he be abſent, generally wee ſorow not for his ſickneſſe if he be ſicke, generally wee take no ſuch pleaſure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his preſence, or in his life. Nay rather if he be abſent we will wiſh him farre enough, and to tarie long enough; and if he be ſicke vnto death wee will reioyce and be glad at his death: So farre ſhort of theſe <hi>Philippians</hi> that were but newly planted in the Church, and had but lately embraced the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, are wee who haue long enioyed the miniſterie of the word, and the bright light of the holy word of truth. For ſo they accounted, that the Apoſtle could not haue giuen a greater token of loue of them, then to ſend their miniſter backe againe vnto them, and it was the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ioy of heart that might be vnto them to ſee their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter againe thorowly well, and in good health. And ſurely if we tooke that ioy and comfort in the word that we ought, we would take more ioy and comfort in the Miniſters of the word then we doe. But how the Miniſters of the word are to be accounted of, we ſhall ſee in the handling of the next verſe that followeth. It now followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I might be the leſſe ſorowfull]</hi> In theſe words the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle ſetteth downe a third cauſe or reaſon why hee ſent their Miniſter vnto them with ſuch diligence and ſpeede. And this
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:599:285"/> cauſe reſpected himſelfe. For it was that hee might be the leſſe ſorowfull. 1. That howſoeuer his ſorowes after this ſhould be ſome for ſome other things, yet they might bee the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In that then that the Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>and that I might be without ſorow,</hi> but onely, <hi>and that I might be the leſſe ſorowfull.</hi> Hence I gather this obſeruation, that the children of God are not much to hope, nor greatly to ſeeke in this life to be quit and ridde of all ſorow, but it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them if their ſorowes be abated, and if they haue leſſe ſorow then they deſerue, and then they are enabled to beare.<note place="margin">

Let vs not therefore looke in this life to be without all trouble, or ſorow, or griefe. Let vs rather conſider how in this life our whole life is ſtained with many ſinnes, and how for our ſinnes wee haue deſerued not only death euerlaſting after this life, but troubles alſo and ſorowes vnſupportable in this life. And then when we ſee that we are not onely freed from that death by the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and by ſaith in his name, but that our ſorowes in this life are much leſſe then we deſerue, let vs reioyce in the Lord, and comfort our ſelues in his mercies that our troubles and ſorowes are nothing in compariſon of that wee haue deſerued. And againe, let vs conſider that howſoeuer our troubles, and
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:599:285"/> ſorowes, and griefes be many, yet ſo onely they preſſe vs, as that we are able to ſay with the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 8.9</note> 
                     <hi>We are affected on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſide, yet are we not in diſtreſſe; in pouertie, but not ouercome of pouertie: we are perſecuted, but not forſaken, caſt downe, but wee periſh not &amp;c.</hi> And then when we ſee that our troubles, and ſorowes, and griefes are no more but ſuch as the Lord hath enabled vs to beare, let vs reioyce in the Lord, and comfort ourſelues in his mercies towards vs, who doth not ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue that wee be able, but giueth the iſſue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the tentation that we may be able to beare it. For ſurely theſe are great mercies of the Lord towards vs, that our ſorowes are ſo leſſened and abated that they are neither ſuch as we haue deſerued, neither ſuch but that wee are able to beare them by the power of him who doth ſtrengthen vs hereunto. And therefore though in this life we be not quite free from all troubles and ſorowes, yet let vs account this a great mercie of the Lord vnto vs that wee are leſſe ſorowfull, that our ſorowes are leſſe then the deſert of our ſins, and leſſe then he enableth vs to beare.</p>
                  <p>But how was it that the Apoſtle ſhould be leſſe ſorowfull by ſending their Miniſter <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> vnto them? becauſe by his preſence they ſhould haue occaſion to reioyce. For as by their heauineſſe for their Miniſter his ſorow was encreaſed, ſo againe by their reioycing for their Miniſter his ſorow would be abated. Here then we may obſerue another notable quali<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of Chriſtian loue and friendſhippe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15</note> which is <hi>to weepe with them that weepe, and to reioyce with them that reioyce.</hi> A rule which the Apoſtle giueth all Chriſtians to obſerue &amp; keep, &amp; from which who ſo declineth may ſeem therin to croſſe euen nature it ſelfe. For naturally we ſee that the members of our body are ſo affected one towards an other, as that if one mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber ſuffer all ſuffer with it, and if one be had in honour,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26</note> 
                     <hi>all the members reioyce with it.</hi> How much more ſhould it be ſo in the myſticall body of Chriſt Ieſus, that they who are ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one faith, and in one baptiſme, ſhould ſo likewiſe be ioyned together in loue and affection one towards an other that the ſorow of one ſhould be the ſorow of an other, and the ioy of one ſhould be the ioy of another? But I haue had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:599:286"/> heretofore to obſerue this note vnto you, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the great want of this Chriſtian loue in vs one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, for that we are ſo farre from this duty, as that we weepe and are ſorie one at the proſperitie of another, and againe laugh and reioyce one at the calamity of another. If either by that or this inſtruction ye be taught in this dutie, then pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it; and if either by that or this admonition ye ſee your want in the performance of this dutie, then ſtudie to amend that which is amiſſe, and learne ſo to be affected one towards another, as that ye will reioyce with them that reioyce, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine weepe with them that weepe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it may be that the Apoſtle was ſorie that by his oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>caſion their Miniſter and Teacher was ſo long abſent from them. And therefore now when <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was ſent backe againe vnto them he was the leſſe ſorowfull. But this being onely a coniecture my purpoſe is not to ground any obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereupon. Onely this, neither may the example of the Apoſtle be any preſident for any to deteine the Miniſter from his charge, neither may the example of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> be to any Miniſter any preſident to abſent himſelfe from his charge. For <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was now abſent from his people being ſent by them to Miniſter to the neceſſities of the holy Apoſtle, ſo that albeit he was abſent from them yet was hee labouring for them euen in the worke of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the laſt verſe of this chapter. How then can this example help them who abſent themſelues either for idleneſſe and their owne eaſe, or vpon other pretences which haue no lawfull warrant? Againe his ſtaying there with the Apoſtle was not ſo much by the Apoſtle his deteining of him, as by the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> charge that he ſhould ſtay with him, and by the ſickeneſſe wherewith God viſited him. How then can this example bee any warrant vnto them whom deteine Miniſters from their charge, either for their owne pleaſures ſake, or in ſome other reſpect which hath no better warrant? I wiſh that both theſe men would bee as ſorie for deteining Miniſters from their charge as it is likely the Apoſtle was, and likewiſe that the Miniſters as ſorie for being abſent from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r charges as it is likely <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was. This were a preſident worthy the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:599:286"/> the other is a preſident without all ground, or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of any ſemblance. But I purpoſed onely to touch this by the way. Now followeth the Apoſtle his requeſt for <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Receiue him therefore in the Lord &amp;c.]</hi> The Apoſtle hauing ſhewed the cauſes why he ſent <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> vnto the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> now commendeth him vnto them, and maketh requeſt for him, that they would entertaine him at his returne as they ought, ſhewing withall a reaſon in the next verſe why they ſhould doe ſo. In this verſe, 1. He ſheweth how they ought to receiue and entertaine him in particular. 2. How they ought to entertaine all Miniſters generally being ſuch as he was. Firſt touching the entertainment of him in particular, the Apoſtle willeth them to receiue him, firſt in the Lord, then with all gladneſſe. In that he willeth and exhorteth them to receiue him in the Lord, his meaning is that they ſhould receiue him not as a priuate friend, not as one ſent from him, whom for his ſake they ſhould vſe kindly, but as the ſeruant of the Lord, and as one ſent euen by God himſelfe vnto them. For herein the Apoſtle may in part ſeeme to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude vnto that extremitie of ſickneſſe, whence he could not poſſibly haue beene deliuered but onely by Gods mercy on him. And therefore now he was ſent vnto them, not ſo much by the Apoſtle, as by the Lord, who onely did ſaue his life from death. Againe, in that he exhorteth them to receiue him with all gladneſſe, his meaning is, that as he longed after them all, ſo they ſhould all receiue him with all gladneſſe, euen with exceeding ioy for his comming vnto them. For ſo the ſame words that are heere vſed are well tranſlated <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                  <p>Here then we are taught how to intreat, and entertaine, and receiue the Miniſters of the Lord firſt, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> that is, as ſeruants of the Lord, and ſent by God vnto vs. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle giueth teſtimonie vnto the <hi>Galathians</hi> that they receiued him, where he ſaith, <hi>But yee receiued me as an Angell of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14.</note> 
                     <hi>yea as Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> And that they are ſo to be honored and accounted of, he againe ſheweth where he ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Let a man ſo thinke of vs as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpoſers of the
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:599:287"/> ſecrets of God.</hi> And why are they ſo to be thought of, and ſo to be honoured? The reaſon is plaine, they are the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Chriſt Ieſus, in Chriſt his ſtead beſeeching vs that we would be reconciled vnto God. So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Now then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you through vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note> 
                     <hi>we pray you in Chriſt his ſtead, that yee be reconciled vnto God.</hi> Now Embaſſadors, yee know, are to be receiued as the Prince from whom they are ſent: ſo that the Miniſters of Chriſt are to be receiued euen as Chriſt Ieſus. And therefore our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>He that receiueth you, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40</note> 
                     <hi>and he that receiueth mee receiueth him that ſent mee.</hi> Againe, Embaſſadors (yee know) ſpeake not in their owne name, but in the Princes name that ſent them: ſo that the Miniſters of Chriſt are to be heard as Chriſt whoſe Miniſters they are. And therefore our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me,</hi>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it grieueth mee to ſee how the Miniſters of the Lord are receiued euen in this auditorie. Euery fit opportunitie hath beene taken to put you in minde of theſe things. And what neerer are yee then at the firſt? Are the Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus to be receiued in the Lord, and for the Lord? Are they the Embaſſadors of Chriſt Ieſus, and therefore to be receiued, and to be heard as Chriſt Ieſus? How happens it then that ſome will not at all almoſt come to heare them? that ſome come ſo ſlackly to heare them? and that ſome turne their backs vpon them, and will not ſtay to heare them? If the Embaſſador of an earthly Prince ſhould be vſed in ſuch like ſort, would not ſharpe ſtormes and ſore diſpleaſure fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low vpon it? And ſhall the Embaſſadors of the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and King of Kings be ſo vſed, and will not his anger and heauy diſpleaſure be kindled at it? If we ſought our honour, we might well goe without it, ſeeing the Lord cannot haue it: But we ſeeke not our owne honour, but the honour of him that ſends vs, euen the honour of Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe word we preach vnto you. We would be honored for the words ſake, and therefore we would haue the word much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:599:287"/> And therefore we call you vnto the hearing of the word, euen of the word of life, euen of the word of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. But how preuaile we? Thoſe that will not come, what ſhould I ſpeake vnto them? I iudge them not, there is one that iudgeth them. Of ſuch as doe come, ſome come ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that it may ſeeme they come when their leiſure from other buſineſſe giues them beſt leaue. Buſineſſe belike they haue of greater importance then this, and which they are more to regard then the ſaluation of their ſoules. Others, they turne their backs vpon the Preacher, and ſtay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or they will not. I cannot but ſpeake of it. What an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely thing was it, when the laſt Lords day after the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of that holy ſacrament of Baptiſme, which ſeeing the opportunitie was giuen, might well haue beene celebrated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sermon; but what an vnſeemely thing (I ſay) was it, to ſee ſo many then turne their backs, and goe their waies, ſome vpon that occaſion, and others therein keeping their wonted manner? But take heede, men and brethren, how yee deſpiſe the word, and turne your backs vpon it. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer now yee turne your backs vpon it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48.</note> yet ſhall it iudge you in the laſt day. If there be a fault in any of you, ſtudie to amend it, and let the word of Chriſt dwell in you all plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and in all wiſdome.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>For it is the power of God vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to euery one that beleeueth.</hi> Receiue the Miniſters of Chriſt in the Lord, and harken vnto their meſſage for the Lord. For though they be men that come vnto you, yet are they men ſent from the Lord, and their words are to be heard not as the word of man, but as it is indeede as the word of God. Happy are yee if yee heare theſe things, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thereupon with fruit vnto your ſoules. <hi>Bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it.</hi>

How beautifull then ſhould their feete be vnto vs? When they come vnto vs, or when the Lord rather ſendeth them vnto vs with what gladneſſe ſhould wee receiue them? Surely I will tell you. Conſider that place yet a litle further. The Prophet there ſpeaketh firſt and primarily of the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the children of Iſrael out of the captiuitie of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and of them that ſhould bring the meſſage and gladd tydings therof. With what gladnes then may we thinke would the children of Iſraell, when they were in the land of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, receiue them that would bring them good tydings of their deliuerance out of captiuitie, and returne vnto their countrie, and ancient libertie? Would not all of them receiue them with great gladneſſe? Would not all of them receiue them with exceding and vnfained ioy and reioycing? With what gladneſſe then ſhould we receiue the Miniſters of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, who bring vnto vs moſt ioyfull tidings of a moſt bleſſed deliuerance out of the moſt wofull thrall and captiuitie that euer was, euen out of the moſt tyrannicall cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of ſinne, death, and the deuill?

A good ſhew of ſuch glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe many of the Iewes then gaue, when Chriſt riding into Ieruſalem on an Aſſe, they ſpred their garments in the way, and cut downe branches from the trees, and ſtrawed them in the way, and cryed through the ſtreets of Ieruſalem, and ſaid, <hi>Hoſanna the ſonne of Dauid,</hi>

Thus yee ſee with what gladnes the Miniſters of the Goſpell ought to be receiued: yee ſee how our Sauiour Chriſt the high Prieſt of our profeſſion was thus receiued when towards his paſſion he came downe from the mount of Oliues vnto Ieruſalem: yee ſee how the Diſciples and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of our Sauiour Chriſt were thus receiued, euen with great ioy of all the brethren. And thus at this day the Miniſters of the Goſpell are receiued, euen with all gladneſſe of all the brethren. But as then it was, ſo now it is, the multitude, of the brethren no great multitude, as may eaſily appeare euen by this one note, that the multitude of them that receiue the Miniſters of the Goſpell with all gladnes is no great multitude. Well (beloued) to ſtand no longer vpon this point, I cannot better exhort you touching this point then out of theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Receiue the miniſters of Chriſt his Goſpell in the Lord, receiue them with all gladnes, and make much of them,</hi> for ſo it followeth.</p>

                        </gap>.</note> for ſo the word here vſed in the originall ſignifieth. But whom muſt we haue in ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Make much of ſuch; ſuch as <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> ſuch as faithfully and painefully worke in the Lord his harueſt, ſuch as carefully watch for our ſoules, as they that muſt giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, ſuch as labour in the word and doctrine make much of them, and account them worthy of double honor.</p>
                  <p>Here then we are taught in what account we are to haue ſuch Miniſters of the Goſpell as faithfully and painefully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the word and doctrine. We are to make much of them, we are to haue them in high honor and eſtimation, we are to account them worthy of double honor. For ſo the Apoſtle elſe where alſo telleth vs, ſaying,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17</note> 
                     <hi>The Elders which rule well are worthy of double honour, eſpecially they which labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> Where whatſouer be meant by double honour in particular, in generall it is meant, that all honour is due vnto them that labour in the word and doctrine. Yea indeede? honour ſuch? make much of ſuch, ſuch finde-faults, ſuch troublers of the ſtate, ſuch hot-headed fellowes, ſuch diſcoueries of their fathers ſhame, ſuch publiſhers of whatſoeuer they know, euen in <hi>Gath,</hi> and <hi>Aſhkelon.</hi> For thus commonly they are accounted of, eſpecially if according to the neceſſitie of the times they lift vp their voices like trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and ſhew the people their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> their ſinnes. If they tell <hi>Herod</hi> of his inceſt, they may doe it without that danger that <hi>Iohn</hi> did, but let them looke for no leſſe then to be counted troublers of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.25.</note> as <hi>Elias</hi> was accounted by <hi>Ahab.</hi> If <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men men with him be like to ſuſtaine any loſſe by their preaching; if the godles Atheiſt, or the ſuperſtitious Papiſt thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues galled by their preaching, then they traduce them by ſuch and ſuch names, and then they raiſe vp whatſoeuer trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles poſſibly they can againſt them. Thus are they rewarded with euill for good, and with hatred for their good will; thus doe they become enemies becauſe they tell the truth; thus
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:599:290"/> are they honoured and accounted of the world; thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are they made of in the world that are carefull not to doe the worke of the Lord negligently. Yea and ſee the ſtrangeneſſe of it. The cauſe why we ſhould make much of the Miniſters of the Goſpell is, for the meſſage ſake which they bring vnto vs, becauſe they bring vnto vs the holy word of life, the Manna, and foode of our ſoules; and becauſe out of it they both teach vs that truth which we are to beleeue and imbrace, and improue thoſe errors which we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and auoide, and correct thoſe faults in our life which we are to flie and deteſt, and inſtruct vs in that way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherein we are to walke all the daies of our life.

                  <p>Beloued, I haue vrged this point, touching the Miniſters of the Goſpell, of receiuing them in the Lord, of receiuing them with all gladneſſe, of making much of them, partly the laſt day, and partly this day: For your ſakes, that yee might know how to vſe the Miniſters of the word, that ſo yee may
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:599:290"/> giue teſtimonie how yee honor the word. For as men like or miſlike the Miniſters of the word, ſo commonly they are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards the word. Let the word of Chriſt therefore dwell in you plenteouſly, let your delight be in the law of the Lord, and loue the word of life as your life: and for a proofe thereof, ſuch as faithfully and painefully labour in the word and doctrine, receiue them in the Lord, receiue them with all gladnes, and make much of ſuch. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe that for the worke of Chriſt &amp;c.]</hi> This is the reaſon which the Apoſtle bringeth why the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould receiue their Miniſter in the Lord, and with all gladnes. The reaſon then briefly is this: <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was neere vnto death for the worke of Chriſt, and regarded not his life to fulfill that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice &amp;c. therefore yee ought to receiue him in the Lord, and with all gladnes. By the worke of Chriſt the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth in this place that whole paines and labour which <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> tooke in comming to him to <hi>Rome,</hi> in bringing with him that releefe which the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſent vnto him, and in miniſtring vnto him in priſon ſuch things as he wanted. A ſeruice well called the worke of Chriſt, becauſe commanded by Chriſt, and performed to the ſeruant of Chriſt for Chriſt his ſake. Againe, in that the Apoſtle in the end of the verſe ſaith, <hi>to fulfill that ſeruice &amp;c.</hi> the Apoſtle his meaning is not thereby to note any fault in the <hi>Philippians,</hi> as if they had beene any way wanting vnto him, but therein he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his faithfull and painefull performance of that ſeruice, which they if they had beene preſent with him would haue done, but now could not becauſe of their farre diſtance from him. The whole reaſon is indeed drawne from the commendation of <hi>Epaphroditus.</hi> His commendation is that he took ſuch paines with him and for him that it had been like to haue coſt him his life, and that hee made not ſo much reckoning of his life as he did of diſcharging that truſt that was repoſed in him, and performing that ſeruice which the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> themſelues would haue done if they had beene preſent. This (I ſay) is the commendation which the Apoſtle here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, and for this cauſe he willeth them to receiue him in the Lord with gladneſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:599:291"/>
                  <p>Whence I gather this generall obſeruation, that it is a very commendable thing in the ſeruants of Chriſt, not to regard their liues vnto the death, but to hazard their liues for the worke of Chriſt, which either Chriſt hath commanded them to doe in their place whatſoeuer, or which for Chriſt his ſake they are to performe vnto any ſeruant of Chriſt. What thing more commendable or memorable in <hi>Eſther,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">4.11.</note> Yet for this worke of God, the deliuerance of his Church from the deuouring ſword ſhee put her life in moſt eminent danger, <hi>and went in into the King,</hi>

                     <hi>which was not according to the law.</hi> We ſee it likewiſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto the view of all poſteritie touching the Apoſtles, that <hi>their liues were not deare vnto them ſo that they might fulfill their courſe with ioy;</hi> that <hi>they were ready not to be bound onely, but alſo to die for the name of the Lord Ieſus;</hi> that howſoeuer they were threatned, yet they would not ceaſe to preach in the name of Chriſt Ieſus.

Yea and what if we ſhould not onely hazard our liues, but giue vp our liues for any worke of Chriſt?

                     <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> by all theſe hazard our ſelues and our liues for their good, and ſuch things as may be needfull for them. If any brother be ſicke, though it be with ſome danger let vs viſit him, and comfort him. If for the worke of our miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie we be ſo preſſed that in our ſelues we receiue the ſentence of death, as our holy Apoſtle was often preſſed, yet let vs not ſhrinke, but let vs declare vnto the people all the words of the Lord, and ſpeake of all the iudgements of his mouth. In a word, in whatſoeuer worke of Chriſt (for I doe not now ſpeake of this worke alone here mentioned) but in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer worke of Chriſt which he hath commanded vs in our places to doe, or which being done for his ſake hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth as done for himſelfe, let vs be bold in the Lord, let not our liues bee dearer vnto vs then the performance of his will, but let vs hazard our liues for the worke of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But here the doubt may be made, and the queſtion deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whether we are alwaies to hazard our liues for the worke of Chriſt, whether in ſome worke of Chriſt we may not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times withdraw our ſelues from danger, and prouide for our health, &amp; for our liues? As for example, whether we may not forbeare the viſiting of the ſick, when the ſicknes is peſtilentiall and contagious, whether in ſuch times we may not prouide for our health, &amp; for our liues? The queſtion I know is hard, and the doubt not eaſily anſwered, neither will I take vpon me the deciſion of the doubt: only I ſhew my opinion, and willingly ſubmit it to the iudgement of others. Touching priuate men therefore, I meane ſuch as whoſe place and office doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require a more publike care then of themſelues &amp; of their own family, they may in my iudgment ſpare themſelues, and not hazard their health or their liues, but for the time withdraw themſelues from the danger, eſpecially if ſuch reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable order be taken for the ſicke, as that by comming vnto them they may more endanger themſelues &amp; others, then doe them good. My reaſons are theſe, 1. By the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we ſee that thoſe that were troubled with any contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as with the leproſie,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leu.</hi> 13 46.</note> they were commanded to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and to haue their habitation without the campe, and in places where they came to cry, <hi>I am vncleane, I am vncleane.</hi>
                     <pb n="560" facs="tcp:599:292"/> Which doth plainely ſhew that all were not to come vnto them, but both they were to giue warning vnto others, and others were to take warning by them, leſt happily they ſhould be infected by them, if they ſhould come vnto them. Againe, howſoeuer in ſuch caſes we could be content to hazard our ſelues and our owne liues, yet may we and we ought to haue care ouer our owne houſhold, and ouer that charge that is committed to vs.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>For if there be any</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that prouideth not for his owne, and namely for them of his houſhold, be denieth the faith, and is worſe then an infidell.</hi> We muſt then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for our owne, as for their wealth in good ſort, and things neceſſarie to this life, ſo for their health, and therefore auoide ſuch occaſions as whereby wee might bring their health in danger. Againe, we haue many examples in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that great <hi>Eliah,</hi> of our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, of the bleſſed Apoſtles, and of many others that did for the time auoide ſuch dangers as otherwiſe would haue ouertaken them, and did not alwaies thinke it meete to hazard themſelues in euery occurrent danger. Which reaſon I doe the rather in this place bring, becauſe if they might, then much more priuate men ſometimes may for the time withdraw themſelues from danger.</p>
                  <p>Now if here it be obiected and ſaid, that auoiding of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and other dangers is an argument of diſtruſt in God, and therefore we may not withdraw our ſelues in ſuch times; I anſwer that it is no ſure argument. The wicked indeede withdraw themſelues in ſuch times of danger becauſe they diſtruſt in God, and thinke that God either cannot or will not helpe them, and deliuer them from the danger: and ſuch auoiding of ſickneſſe or other danger is wicked and vngodly. The children of God therefore withdraw themſelues, becauſe they know that it is lawfull to vſe ſuch remedies againſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as are lawfull and good: and ſuch auoiding is lawfull. Againe, if it be ſaid that to auoid at ſuch times is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe God hath certainly decreed whom to take and whom to leaue at ſuch times, and none but they alone ſhall die; I anſwer, that in like ſort it may be ſaid, that it was to no purpoſe for <hi>Iacob</hi> to ſend into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy corne,<note place="margin">Gen.</note> becauſe
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:599:292"/> God had certainly decreed to ſaue him and his familie from the famine:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 27.</note> and likewiſe to no purpoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould keepe the mariners from flying out of the ſhip by boat, leſt all ſhould periſh, becauſe God had decreed to ſaue all them that ſailed with them. And yet wee ſee that both <hi>Iacob</hi> ſent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> cauſed the ſouldiers to cut off the ropes of the boat, both vſing ſuch meanes as God had ordained whereby to bring his will to paſſe, and therein leauing vs an enſample to doe the ſame. Againe, if it be ſaid that it is a ſcandall ſo to withdraw our ſelues, I anſwer that it is a ſcandall taken, not giuen. Againe, if it be ſaid that whereas wee ſhould loue our neighbours as our ſelues, thus wee doe forſake them, and ſo leaue the rule of loue and charitie. I anſwer, that to leaue them for a time, when there are either ſome of their friends, or ſome others prouided for the nonce to looke vnto them, is not to forſake them, neither is againſt the rule of loue and charitie. Nay it were very prepoſterous loue and charitie ſo to be deuoted vnto this or that priuate friend, as by that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to bring in danger a whole familie or charge whatſoeuer committed vnto them. Neither doe I know any thing which can be brought to croſſe that which hath beene ſaid touching priuate mens auoiding of dangers, which may not as eaſily be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Now touching publike men, Magiſtrates and Miniſters, the doubt is ſomewhat more difficult. To inſtance in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to ſhew mine opinion in briefe, in my iudgement the Miniſters are firſt and principally to looke vnto the good of the whole Church, and then vnto the good of euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member thereof. If there bee many Miniſters of one Church, ſome one by lot or common conſent may be depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to regard the ſicke, and the reſt may auoid the danger. But if there be but one, he is ſo to be carefull for the ſicke, as that the reſt of the Church may not be depriued of his miniſterie. Hee may and muſt comfort the ſicke, and goe vnto them in ſuch ſort, and ſo neere as hee well can without danger: and againe, he may and muſt auoid manifeſt danger for the good of the reſt of the Church ſo much as he can without impietie. Neither may too much feare withdraw him too much from
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:599:293"/> danger, neither through too much boldneſſe may hee thruſt himſelfe too much into danger: for by too much feare hee is more ſlow to the worke of Chriſt then he ſhould be, and by too much boldneſſe he more endangereth both himſelfe and the Church then hee ſhould. To conclude the whole point therefore, howſoeuer it be moſt true that it is a very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable thing in the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt to hazzard their liues as <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> did for the worke of Chriſt, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both priuate and alſo publike men may withdraw themſelues from danger in ſuch ſort as already hath beene ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Another particular obſeruation hence I gather, which is this, that releeuing them that are in bonds and in priſon, and miniſtring vnto the neceſſities of Gods Saints vpon earth, is a worke of Chriſt; for ſo the Apoſtle in this place, as wee ſee, calleth it. It is, I ſay, a worke of Chriſt, ſuch a one as hee commandeth,<note place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He holy Apoſtle hauing in the firſt chapter of this Epiſtle, firſt ſignified his good minde towards the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by retaining them in perfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, by his longing after them all from the very heart roote in Ieſus Chriſt, and by his praying for them, and hauing afterward exhorted them that they ſhould not ſhrinke for his impriſonment, becauſe thereby the Goſpell was confirmed and not diminiſhed: In the ſecond Chapter as we haue heard, he firſt exhorted them vnto humility, that putting apart all contention and vaine glory, they would haue euen the ſame minde that was in Chriſt Ieſus, who being God humbled himſelfe to be man, and became obedient to the death, euen the death of the Croſſe, and was therefore highly exalted &amp;c. 2. Hauing
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:599:295"/> grounded certaine exhortations vpon that example of Chriſt his humilitie and obedience, as 1. That they would runne forward in that race of righteouſneſſe wherein God had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed them through Ieſus Chriſt, making an end of their ſaluation with feare and trembling; and then that they would doe all things with their neighbours without murmuring and reaſonings, that they might be blameleſſe and pure, and the ſonnes of God &amp;c. The Apoſtle I ſay hauing grounded theſe exhortations vpon that example of Chriſt his humilitie and obedience. 2. For their comfort and confirmation againſt certaine falſe Apoſtles crept in amongſt them, hee both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhortly vnto them, and likewiſe that himſelfe would ſhortly after that come vnto them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſent their Miniſter, <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> preſently vnto them. Now in this 3. Chapter the Apoſtle inſtructeth the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the things wherein the falſe Apoſtles laboured to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, and ſo armeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> againſt them till his comming vnto them by confuting that falſe doctrine which they deliuered. The doctrine which the falſe Apoſtles deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered was, that not Chriſt alone, and faith in his name, but circumciſion alſo and the workes of the law were neceſſarie vnto iuſtification, and ſaluation. Which doctrine the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth at large confute in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſuffered themſelues to be ſeduced and bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. But here, becauſe the <hi>Philippians</hi> had manfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, and giuen it no place amongſt them, the Apoſtle ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefly confuteth it, and proueth that our righteouſneſſe is onely by Chriſt, and faith in his name, not at all by the works of the Law. The principall parts of this Chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er are three: 1. He exhorteth them to beware of falſe Teachers, verſe 2. and inſtructeth them in that truth which the falſe Apoſtles gaineſay, verſ. 3. 2. The Apoſtle propoſeth himſelfe as an imbracer of that truth touching mans righteouſneſſe which they were to embrace, <hi>à verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ad</hi> 15. Laſtly, hee exhorteth them to embrace and hold faſt the ſame truth with him, and to walke as they haue him for an enſample, from verſ. 15. to the end of the Chapter. Now before he come to the handling of any of theſe principall parts, 1. He ſetteth downe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:599:295"/> 
                     <hi>reioyce in the Lord,</hi> as a concluſion of that which went before, &amp; as a ground of that which followeth. 2. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mſelfe for writing now the ſame things by epiſtle which before he had taught them by word of mouth. That the exhortation is ſet downe partly by way of concluſion of that which he had ſpoken before, may appeare by the entrance vnto it, in that he ſaith, <hi>Moreouer &amp;c.</hi> For it is as if the Apoſtle had thus ſaid: hitherto ye haue been full of heauines partly for my bonds and impriſonment,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>s I haue told you, haue turned rather to the furthering of the Goſpell, inaſmuch as many of the brethren in the Lord are boldned through my bonds to ſpeake the word, and now ſo it is that I am in good hope ſhortly to be deliuered from my bonds, and to come vnto you. Again, for <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> God hath had mercy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and now he is returned vnto you in good and perfect health. What therefore now remaineth my brethren, but that ye be glad and reioyce in the Lord, in the Lord I ſay whom before I haue deſcribed vnto you, in that Lord who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the forme of God thought it no robberie to be equall with God, yet made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant, &amp;c. Reioyce, for that there is no other cauſe but that ye ſhould reioyce, but reioice in the Lord who became man for you, died for your ſinnes, roſe againe for your iuſtification, ſetteth at the right hand of God to make requeſt for you, vnto whom euery knee in that day ſhall bowe, and confeſſe that he is the Lord, reioyce in him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is partly ſet downe as a ground of that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; as if the Apoſtle ſhould thus haue ſaid; I haue already as in a glaſſe preſented vnto your view <hi>the great myſterie of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, euen God manifeſted in the fleſh, iuſtified in the ſpirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeene of Angels, preached vnto the Gentiles, belieued on in the world, and receiued vp into glory.</hi> He it is, and he alone it is that is made of God vnto you wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and redemption that hee that reioyceth might reioyce in him. Reioyce therefore in him, and beware of ſuch as teach you to reioyce in any thing but in him. Thus ye ſee how this exhortation is partly a concluſion of that which went before, and partly a ground and foundation of that which followeth.
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:599:296"/> The excuſe which followeth, is to meete with that conceit which the <hi>Philippians</hi> happily might haue vpon his often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. Firſt by word, and now by writing, to beware of falſe Apoſtles. For thus the Apoſtle thought they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and thinke with themſelues; you haue often when you were with vs admoniſhed vs of falſe Apoſtles and Teachers, when you taught vs and preached vnto vs Chriſt Ieſus you ceaſed not to warne vs to beware of ſuch as would ſeeke to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs from that truth which you taught vs; and wee haue beene diligent ſo to doe, neither haue we giuen place to any of their doctrines: And therefore you needed not to haue troubled your ſelfe; this admonition needed not to vs, The Apoſtle therefore to meete with this telleth them, that for him it is no griefe or trouble to him at all to write the ſame things vnto them which before hee had taught them by word of mouth, and for them hee telleth them that it is a ſure and a ſafe thing that they be often admoniſhed of falſe Teachers, that ſo they may be the more warie of them. Thus much for the vnderſtanding of theſe words. Now before wee proceed any farther, let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence. For our vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The 1. thing which here I note is the maner how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth exhort the <hi>Philippians,</hi> which is in moſt milde, and kinde, and good ſort, ſpeaking vnto them as vnto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yea calling them his brethren: not that they were his brethren naturally according to the fleſh by carnall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but his brethren in Chriſt, begotten in one wombe of the Church the ſpouſe of Chriſt, vnto one God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and father of vs all, by one immortall ſeed the word of God, through one ſpirit whereinto we are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, borne by ſpirituall generation not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. Exhorting then the <hi>Philippians</hi> whom hee had begotten in the faith vnto Chriſt by his miniſterie, hee ſpeaketh vnto them as vnto his brethren in Chriſt moſt mildly, and kindly, and louingly. So we ſee he doth in the ſecond Chapter and twelfth verſe, where exhorting them to humilitie and obedience, and to finiſh their ſaluation with feare and trembling, hee ſpeaketh thus vnto
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:599:296"/> them, <hi>wherefore my beloued, as ye haue alwaies obeyed &amp;c.</hi> So in the next Chapter he ioyneth both theſe together, and a great deale more, and ſaith, <hi>Therefore my brethren, beloued and longed for, my ioy and my crowne &amp;c.</hi> Moſt milde and louing exhortations. And wherefore vſeth hee ſuch mildneſſe in his exhortations vnto them? No doubt the rather to winne them to hearken vnto him and vnto that whereto hee exhorteth them. For as ſharpe and bitter words often ſtirres vp ſtriefe and anger, ſo a ſoft tongue, milde and louing ſpeeches much auaile to effect that which a man deſires. Here then is a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for vs whom God hath ſet apart vnto the holy worke of his miniſterie, that we ſhould not onely be carefull to inſtruct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A thing practiſed by Chriſt himſelfe, and practiſed likewiſe by the Apoſtles of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as by many places in the new Teſtament it may eaſily appeare. Here then happily you will ſay vnto me, how is it then that many of you are ſo ſharpe and eager in ſpeech? how is it that ye follow not the practiſe of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles? We are indeed ſometimes ſharpe, wee come ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a rodde, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, yea ſometimes we bring an axe with vs, and lay it to the roote of the tree to cut it downe, that it may be caſt into the fire, ſometimes we pluck vp, and roote out, and throw downe, ſometimes wee ſtrike, and wound, and kill, and herein wee follow the practiſe of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles.

Againe, when the ſoule is afflicted and brought low through any plague or trouble, when the ſorowfull heart ſhrinketh in the way and groneth vnder the burthen of his ſinne, when men beginne to loath and deteſt thoſe wicked waies wherein they haue walked, and to long and thirſt after
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:599:297"/> the things that belong vnto their peace, then it is as a time to come in the ſpirit of meekneſſe, to ſpeake comfortably vnto the heart, to raiſe vp them that are fallen with all kinde ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and in all louing manner to lead them on a long beſides the water of comfort.

The ſinner that goeth on in the wickedneſſe of his way, and runneth headlong into many and noyſome luſts, we ſharply reproue, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime him from the wickedneſſe of his way, and that wee may pull him as a brand out of the fire leſt he ſhould periſh in the day of Chriſt. But ſuch as are grieued becauſe they are out of the right way, and grope after it if happily they might finde it, them we reſtore with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, wee poure oyle into their wounds, with all mildneſſe wee exhort them, and we miniſter what word of comfort wee can vnto them.

To be glad, and to be merry, and to reioyce, is a thing which the heart of man very much euen naturally deſireth, ſo that there needeth no precept or exhortation at all that wee ſhould reioyce: but what and wherein our reioycing ſhould be, is a matter very well worthy our due and diligent conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides this carnall and worldly reioycing, there is alſo a Chriſtian and ſpirituall reioycing, which is, when ſetting our hearts on the Lord as on our chiefeſt good, wee ſo reioyce in the things of this life, as that wee count them all loſſe and dung in compariſon of that reioycing which wee haue in Chriſt Ieſus; when remembring the mercifull goodneſſe and louing kindneſſe of our good God, nothing can ſo much daunt vs, but that our heart daunceth for ioy, and our ſoules are rauiſhed with reioycing thereat. Wilt thou then reioyce, or know how and wherein to reioyce, O man that feareſt the Lord? Reioyce in the Lord: reioyce in thoſe ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings wherewithall God hath bleſſed thee in heauenly things in Chriſt Ieſus: reioyce in thine election in Chriſt Ieſus vnto eternall life before the foundation of the world: reioyce in the workmanſhip of thy creation after Gods owne image, in thy redemption by the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus, when through diſobedience thou hadſt for euer caſt thy ſelfe away; in thine adoption through Ieſus Chriſt into the number of the ſonnes of God; in thy reconciliation with God the Father by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion and mediation of Chriſt Ieſus; in thy vocation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the truth by the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus; in thine incorporation into the myſticall body of Chriſt Ieſus by the powerfull operation of the ſpirit; in thy iuſtification and free forgiueneſſe of thy ſinnes by faith in the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus; in thy ſanctification by the ſpirit of grace vnto ſome meaſure of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe in this life; in thy regeneration vnto a liuely hope in Chriſt Ieſus, and in the aſſured confidence of thy glorification after this life with Ieſus, who ſhall change thy vile body, that it may be faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like vnto his glorious body, &amp;c. Herein is the Chriſtian mans reioycing, and here is matter of reioycing indeed. All reioycing in all things in the world whatſoeuer, what is it in compariſon of this reioycing? Surely as euen now wee heard out of <hi>Iob,</hi> it is ſhort, and but a moment. Nay I ſay more, Whatſoeuer men imagine with themſelues, yet indeed there
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:599:299"/> is no true ioy, no ſound reioycing, but this reioycing in the Lord. Other ioyes in other things may happily for the time ſomewhat affect vs, and pleaſe our fancies, and tickle our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes, and delight our outward man: but that that warmes the heart, that that cheeres the ſoule, that that makes the inner man to pant and to leape for ioy, thats the ioy in the holy Ghoſt, and reioycing in the Lord. And this is it which ſtickes by a man in his life, and in his death forſakes him not. Yea, when in the throwes and pangs of death he ſhall ſay of all other ioyes whatſoeuer, I haue no pleaſure in them, then in this ioy his ſoule ſhall reioyce, through this ioy hee ſhall ioyfully wreſtle with death, and becauſe of this ioy hee ſhall not feare death, nor the graue, but deſire to bee looſed, and to be with Chriſt. Let the carnall, and worldly, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuall men therefore bragge and boaſt as much as they will, that they leade the only ioyfull and pleaſant liues, and let them obiect vnto the godly Chriſtian as much as they will, a lumpiſh, and momiſh, and ſowre life, wherein he hath no ioy or pleaſure at all, yet ſhall the day come when they ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yea but how ſhall wee know this, that indeed wee doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the Lord? For wee are inclined naturally to flatter our ſelues, and wee will ſay that wee reioyce in the Lord and perhaps thinke ſo too, when indeed wee doe not.

                  <p>Another effect of this reioycing in the Lord is, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to reioyce in tribulations, in afflictions, in tentations, euen in death, and in the panges and paines thereof.

They muſt be delighted with variety, and great diuerſitie of matter, or elſe they will be quickly weary in hearing of vs. Here it is indeede: ſo dainty are the eares of our auditorie that they cannot away with it to heare the ſame things ſo often. They muſt haue nouelties, they muſt haue varietie of matter though when they haue heard they cannot make any account of that they haue heard.

So irkeſome are the ſame things vnto our auditorie, be they neuer ſo good, and ſo deſirous are they to heare diuers things, though nothing ſo good and profitable vnto them. In regard therefore of them we muſt not ſo often ſpeake of the ſame things, becauſe they like it not, as not either needfull, or not profitable for them. Heare then (I beſeech you) what our holy Apoſtle ſaith for your inſtruction in this point. <hi>For you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is a ſure thing, a ſafe and good courſe for you, that yee be often told of the ſame things.</hi> See then the odds betweene your conceit, and the Apoſtle his reſolution. To heare often of the ſame things is a tedious thing to you: but the Apoſtle thinketh it a very ſure and ſafe thing for you. You muſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue variety and that yee thinke beſt for you: but the Apoſtle thinketh it good for you to be often put in minde of the ſame things. The reaſons why it is good for you often to heare the ſame things are theſe. 1. By hearing the ſame things often your dull and vnexpert vnderſtandings are much holpen: For thus the things which happily at the firſt ſeemed hard to be vnderſtood, and which you were not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and conceiue do afterwards become plaine and eaſie vnto you. And this is the reaſon why ſometimes we do ſo long ſtand a teaching the ſame leſſon vnto them that are yong cholers in the doctrine of faith, and inexpert in the word of righteouſneſſe. 2 By hearing the ſame things often you are ſtirred vp both vnto greater carefullneſſe, and likewiſe vnto greater warineſſe then otherwiſe happily yee would. For if the things be ſuch as you ſhould learne and follow after, yee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill quickly ſee that they much concerne you, becauſe they are ſo often beaten vpon, and therefore yee will be carefull to lay them vp in your hearts, and to practiſe them in your liues. And this was the reaſon why the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to put them (vnto whom he wrote) in minde of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>me thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s, euen that the more diligent they ſaw him to put
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:599:303"/> them in minde of the ſame things, they might be the more carefull to harken to thoſe things whereof he ſo often put them in minde. Againe if the things be ſuch as you ſhould beware and auoide, this often ſpeaking of them will make you the more warie of them, becauſe yee will eaſily coniecture that ſurely the danger is great when the caueats are ſo often and ſo carefully giuen. And this was the reaſon why our Apoſtle firſt when he was with them by word of mouth, and now againe by writing ceaſed not to warne the <hi>Philippians</hi> of falſe teachers, euen that the more carefull they ſaw the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to giue them warning of falſe teachers, they might be ſo much the more warie of them. As then it ought not to grieue vs to ſpeake the ſame things often vnto you, ſo let it not bee weariſome vnto you to heare the ſame things often of vs. You ſee the Apoſtle ſaith it is a ſure thing, and a good thing for you, and yee heare the reaſons why it is good for you. Let this ſuffice to moderate that ouer great niceneſſe and dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is in ſome, and that ſuch an ouer-itching humor that is in ſome after varietie that they cannot at all away with it to heare the ſame things often. When the things are of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie moment and behoofe for you, let it not be tedious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to you to heare of them againe, and againe; and when things are ſo carefully and ſo often ſuggeſted vnto you, aboue all things take heede that yee harken vnto the things ſo ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, leſt that come vpon you which is mentioned in the place of <hi>Eſay</hi> before alledged, that is, leſt when there hath beene <hi>precept vpon precept, precept vpon precept, line vnto line, line vnto line, there a litle, and there a litle,</hi> and yet yee would not heare, afterwards it come to paſſe by the iuſt iudgement of God, that there be precept vpon precept, precept vpon precept, line vnto line, line vnto line, there a litle, and there a litle, but then <hi>hearing you ſhall heare and not vnderſtand, and ſeeing yee ſhall ſee and not perceiue.</hi> For it is a iuſt thing with God, that if yee will not heare when the booke of God is ſo wide opened vnto you, and the ſame things ſo often gone ouer and ouer, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the word be vnto you as the words of a booke that is ſealed vp, that is, altogether vnprofitable, or elſe that it bee quite taken from you and giuen vnto them that will hearken
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:599:303"/> and obey. Let it therefore neither grieue them that ſpeake to ſpeake the ſame things often when they are good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neither let it ſeeme tedious and weariſome vnto you that heare to heare the ſame things often when they are ſuch; and aboue all things hearken vnto ſuch things ſo often ſuggeſted, leſt the things ſo often ſpoken vnto you turne vnto your far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudgement. Now let vs ſee what it was that the Apoſtle thought it not amiſſe for himſelfe ſo often to ſpeake of, and a ſure thing for them ſo often to heare of: it was the taking heede of falſe teachers, ſuch as would ſeeke to ſeduce them from that truth of Chriſt Ieſus which he had taught them. And this is the exhortation or admonition which now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, after this excuſe of the Apoſtle for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beware of dogges &amp;c.]</hi> This is the firſt principall part which we obſerued in this chapter, which in briefe is an exhortation or admonition to beware of falſe teachers; and eſpecially the Apoſtle giueth his caueat of thoſe falſe Apoſtles which were then crept in amongſt them, as the article vſed in the originall doth ſhew; who taught that not Chriſt alone and faith in his name, but circumciſion alſo, and the workes of the law were neceſſarie to iuſtification and ſaluation. Theſe falſe teachers who taught this erroneous and falſe doctrine, the Apoſtle here noteth by the name of doggs, of falſe teachers, and of the conciſion. He calleth them dogs in reſpect of certaine bad qualities wherein they did reſemble dogs. 1. In reſpect of their ſnarling and barking, becauſe as dogs they barked at him, and ſnarled at his doctrine, and that as much without reaſon as the dogge that barks not vpon reaſon, but vpon cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 16.9.</note> And ſo we ſee <hi>Abiſhai</hi> called <hi>Shimei</hi> a dogge in reſpect of his cauſeles barking againſt <hi>Dauid.</hi> 2. In reſpect of their greedineſſe, becauſe as dogs they minded onely their bellies, <hi>making</hi> (as afterward he ſaith) <hi>their belly their God.</hi> And ſo we ſee the Prophet called blinde watchmen, and dumbe dogges.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.11</note> greedy dogges which could neuer haue enough. 3. In reſpect of their abſurdneſſe, becauſe as the dogge returneth to his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſo they of Iewes being made Chriſtians returned againe vnto their olde Iudaiſme, not teaching Chriſt purely, but making a mixture of Iudaiſme and Chriſtianitie. Againe, he
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:599:304"/> calleth them euill workers, 1. in reſpect of the workes which they vrged, becauſe by preaching the neceſſitie of workes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaluation, and ioyning them with Chriſt as workers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him of our ſaluation, they made thoſe workes which in themſelues were not euill, euill workes. For thoſe workes which as they are done according to the law are good, by this addition of neceſſitie, that not Chriſt alone, but they alſo are neceſſarie, as cauſes, vnto ſaluation, are made euill workes. 2. In reſpect of the euill minde wherewith they vrged theſe workes, becauſe they vrged them in hatred of him, and to croſſe that which he had taught touching the ſole ſufficiencie of Chriſt his righteouſneſſe vnto ſaluation. 3. In reſpect of their vnfaithfull working in the Lord his vineyard, becauſe together with good ſeede they did ſow tares in the Lord his field, ioyning with Chriſt the workes of the law in the worke of our ſaluation. Laſtly, he calleth them the conciſion, 1. by alluſion vnto circumciſion which they vrged as neceſſarie to ſaluation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1.</note> ſaying as it is in the Actes, <hi>Except yee be circumciſed after the manner of Moſes ye cannot be ſaued.</hi> 2. Becauſe by vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging circumciſion they did indeed cut the ſeamleſſe coate of Chriſt, and rent the vnitie of the Church, which had now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the circumciſion of Chriſt through baptiſme, and had left off that ceremonie of the law. 3. Becauſe by vrging cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion they ſhewed themſelues to be onely cut in the fore-skinnes of their fleſh, but not to be circumciſed in the heart, by putting off the ſinnefull body of the fleſh through the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Chriſt. Thus the Apoſtle vpon theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and reſpects noteth thoſe falſe Teachers which were crept in amongſt the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and of theſe hee warneth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe, euen three times, to beware.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the obſeruations hence to be gathered, here 1. I note that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that they ſhould beware of falſe Teachers. Whence I obſerue that not Clergie men alone, as they call them, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all the faithfull children of God may and ought to trie and iudge by the Scriptures whether their Teachers &amp; Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers doctrine be true, and ſo to reiect whatſoeuer they finde not proued by the Scriptures, or agreeable to the Scriptures.
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:599:304"/> For how ſhould the <hi>Philippians</hi> beware of falſe Teachers? they ſhould examine and trie their doctrine, and receiue that which was agreeable to that which he had taught them, and reiect that which was not agreeable thereunto. So wee read it regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to the perpetuall commendation of the men of <hi>Berea,</hi>

                     <hi>but trie the ſpirits whether they are of God: for many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> Where the Apoſtle deliuereth a generall doctrine that concerneth euery one of the faithfull as he will auoide the ſeducing and deceits of falſe Teachers, which is that euery man ſhould trie by ſuch rules as the Scripture ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe who is a true or falſe Teacher, which is true or falſe doctrine. And therfore we ſee that the Apoſtle rebuketh the <hi>Galathians</hi> very ſharpely, becauſe they had giuen place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to falſe Apoſtles which corrupted the pure doctrin of Chriſt,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.20.</note> what is to be done? <hi>Eſay</hi> telleth thee: <hi>To the law, and to the teſtimonie: if they ſpeake not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> This then is to be done, when the falſe Prophets and Teachers ſpeake vnto you heare them not, ſo as to reſt on what they ſay, but ſo heare them as that yee exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them by the law and by the teſtimonie; and if they ſpeake not according to this word ſurely they haue no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but are blinde leaders of them, and ſo account of them. Thus then both by the commendable example of the men of <hi>Berea,</hi> and by the precept of the Apoſtles, <hi>Iohn,</hi> and our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and by the ſharpe reproofe of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and by the warrant of the Prophets, it doth and may appeare that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all the faithfull children of God may and ought to trie and iudge by the Scriptures whether their teachers doctrine be true, and ſo to reiect whatſoeuer they finde not agreeable to the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Yea but it will be ſaid, that this were to make the ſheepe iudges of their ſhepheards, and the people to controll their Miniſters. No, not ſo: but the people muſt heart their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and obey them, and be ordered by them, which they will the more cheerefully doe, when by ſearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they ſhall finde their Miniſter and Teachers doctrine to be the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, and not the inuention or tradition of men. If the teachers bring not the truth thus their errors will indeed be deſcried, and no reaſon that when they bring not the truth their doctrine ſhould be receiued as ſound and good. But if they bring the truth, by this ſearch of the ſcriptures the truth which they bring is with the greater lacritie reuerenced and embraced, and themſelues the more honoured and eſteemed. Learne ye then, men and brethren, to make this vſe of this doctrine: 1. To beware of ſuch as teach you otherwiſe then now we haue taught you. Beware of ſuch as will tell you that yee are not to meddle with the ſenſe of the Scripture, or to iudge of ſuch doctrine as ye heare whether it be true or falſe, but yee are onely to trie the ſpirits by taking knowledge of them to whom God hath giuen the gift of diſcerning ſpirits, and by obeying the Church, to

                  <p>A ſecond note of falſe teachers it is, like dogges principally to reſpect their bellies, and more to ſerue their owne bellies then the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for this they take of dogges, to be ſo rauenous and greedie for the bellie, as that through coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:599:307"/> with fained words they make merchandiſe of mens ſoules.

And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe giues the ſame note of them, where he ſaith that they haue hearts exerciſed with couetouſneſſe,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14 3.</note> through couetouſneſſe making marchandiſe of mens ſoules. Such a one was <hi>Balaam,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in the ſame chapter, that he loued the wages of vnrighteouſnes.

Beware of them: they are euill workes making thoſe workes which as they are done according to the Law, are good workes, by this peruerſe doctrine euill workes.</p>
                  <p>A fourth note of falſe teachers it is, like vnto vnfaithfull workmen in the Lord his vineyard, to teach for doctrines
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:599:308"/> mens precepts, and traditions of men. For this falſe teachers take of euill and vnfaithfull workers in the Lord his vineyard, that either in ſtead of the word, or at leaſt together with the pure ſeede of the word, they ſow mens precepts, and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men. Our Sauiour noteth it in the enuious man, that he ſowed tares among the wheat:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.28 <hi>Mar</hi> 7 7.</note> and it is notable in all his brood. Such were thoſe <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes</hi> that we reade of in the Goſpell, of whom it is ſaid, that they taught for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the commandements of men. Whereupon our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our told them that they worſhipped him in vaine. Marke then who now at this day doe thus reſemble vnfaithfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Lord his vineyard. Who are they now that teach you to doe a great number of things for the doing whereof there is no rule at all in the Scriptures? Who are they now that fill your eares with traditions of the Apoſtles, as they ſay, and traditions of the Church, as they ſay, making them euen of equall authoritie with the writings of the Apoſtles? Who are they now that teach you to beleeue otherwiſe then yee are warranted by the Scriptures, the rule of faith? Who are they now that mingle with the pure ſeede of Gods word the chaffe of mans braine, and giue equall authoritie to the written word, and to vnwritten traditions? Doe not ſuch ſhew themſelues to be of the brood of the enuious man? Whoſoeuer they be that doe ſo, they haue a marke of falſe teachers. Marke them therefore, and take heed of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them: they are euill workers, working vnfaithfully in the Lord his vineyard.</p>
                  <p>Now from this alſo, that theſe falſe teachers among the <hi>Philippians</hi> were called the conciſion, ariſe two notes whereby to diſcerne falſe teachers.</p>
                  <p>A fift note therefore of falſe teachers it is, like vnto theſe of the conciſion to cauſe diuiſion and offences contrary to the doctrine of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and to cut themſelues from the vnitie of the Church: for this they take of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that as they cut themſelues from the vnitie of the Church, and cauſed diuiſion in the Church, by vrging the circumciſion of the fleſh, which the Church had done with; ſo commonly falſe teachers rent the vnitie of the Church, and
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:599:309"/> cauſe diuiſions by teaching other doctrine then the ſpirit of God hath taught the Church to receiue. This note of falſe teachers our Apoſtle alſo giues elſewhere, where hee ſaith, <hi>Marke them diligently which cauſe diuiſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which yee haue learned,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17</note> 
                     <hi>and auoid them.</hi> Such were thoſe falſe Apoſtles and teachers which troubled the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> after <hi>Paul</hi> had planted it, who by their ambition brought in ſuch factions, and ſchiſmes, and diſſenſions into the Church,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.</note> that the houſe of <hi>Cloe</hi> a vertuous and zealous woman aduertiſed the Apoſtle thereof. Marke then who now at this day they are that cauſe diuiſion and offences in the Church. Who are they now that labour and plot, and caſt all the wayes they can deuiſe to ſet vs all euery way by the eares together? Who are they now that caſt ſeditious libels amongſt vs, whereby to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Who are they now that ſecretly and in euery corner labour to diſgrace vs, and the doctrine which we teach, and to leſſon you with other doctrine contrary to that ye haue receiued and learned? Doe not theſe whoſoeuer they be cauſe diuiſion, and contention, and offences? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be that doe ſo, they haue a marke of falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Marke them therefore and take heed of them. Beware of them: they reſemble theſe of the conciſion.</p>
                  <p>The laſt note which for this time I obſerue of falſe teachers is, like vnto theſe of the conciſion, to glory and bragge of falſe titles which nothing belong vnto them. For this they take of theſe of the conciſion, that as they gloried falſly in the circumciſion, as anon wee ſhall heare, ſo commonly falſe teachers glory much in the titles, and in the things wherein they haue no right at all to glory. This note alſo of falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> giues, where hee ſaith of them that <hi>they ſpeake ſwelling words of vanitie.</hi>

Who are they now that haue ſtill in their mouthes the Church, the Church, as if they and none but they were the Church of Chriſt? Doe not theſe whoſoeuer they be, bragge of great titles which nothing belong vnto them? Whoſoeuer they bee that doe ſo, they haue a marke of falſe teachers. Marke them therefore, and take heed of them. Beware of them: they reſemble theſe of the conciſion.</p>
                  <p>Many other notes there are whereby falſe teachers may eaſily be deſcried and diſcerned, and which happily might be further gathered euen from this caueat of our Apoſtle in this place. But theſe are ſuch as ſeemed vnto mee moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to offer themſelues to be obſerued from theſe names wherewithall our Apoſtle brandeth theſe falſe teachers. If any deſire to haue them manifeſted by further notes, let him reade 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. where they are at large notified.

They will, I know, tell you that they loue the truth, that they abhorre idolatrie, that they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Apoſtolike faith, that with all reuerence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Scriptures, that they honour religion, and that they deteſt ſuperſtition. They will tell you of their deuotion in praier, of their contempt of riches, of their continencie in life, of their abſtinencie in meats and drinkes, of their workes of charitie, &amp;c. But whatſoeuer they tell you, by theſe notes that I haue told you, ye ſhall know what they are. And when yee know them, take heed and beware of them. For though they come vnto you in ſheepes clothing, yet inwardly they are rauening wolues. Beware of barking dogges which barke againſt the truth, and the profeſſors thereof: and beware of
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:599:310"/> greedie dogges, which through couetouſneſſe make mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of your ſoules. Beware of ſuch workers as make their workes ioynt-workers with Chriſt of out ſaluation: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ſuch workers as worke vnfaithfully in the Lord his vineyard, mingling with the pure ſeede of Gods word the chaffe of mans braine. Beware of ſuch as reſemble the conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in renting the vnitie of the Church, and in cauſing diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and offences contrary to the doctrine which yee haue learned in the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt: and beware of ſuch as reſemble the conciſion in bragging of falſe titles which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belong vnto them. And let theſe things ſuffice to bee noted from this exhortation or caueat. Now followeth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtruction of the <hi>Philippians</hi> touching circumciſion truly ſo called, in theſe words, <hi>For wee are, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For wee are the circumciſion, &amp;c.]</hi> We haue heard how the Apoſtle in his caueat noted the falſe teachers which vrged circumciſion as neceſſary to ſaluation, by the title of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, ſaying, <hi>Beware of the conciſion.</hi> Now in theſe words the Apoſtle giueth the reaſon why he called them the conciſion, <hi>For wee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are the circumciſion.</hi> As if hee ſhould haue ſaid, They are not the circumciſion, though they glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: but rather they are the conciſion, and wee are the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the true circumciſion. Now this hee proueth thus: Wee worſhip God in the ſpirit, therefore wee are the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. And againe, that they worſhip God in the ſpirit hee proueth thus: Wee reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus, and haue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the fleſh; therefore wee worſhip God in the ſpirit. So that the connexion of the points is this: They are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, not the circumciſion: the proofe is this, Wee are the circumciſion, therefore they are not the circumſion. Againe, Wee are the circumciſion: the proofe is this, we worſhip God in the ſpirit; therefore wee are the circumciſion. Againe, we worſhip God in the ſpirit: the proofe is this, wee reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus, and haue no confidence in the fleſh; therefore wee worſhip God in the ſpirit. To gather the whole reaſon into one ſumme, the Apoſtle here proueth that the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles which were among the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and which gloried in their circumciſion, were the conciſion, and not the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:599:310"/> by an argument drawne from the nature of true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, thus: They which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus, and haue no confidence in the fleſh, they are the circumciſion, they are truly circumciſed. But we worſhip God in the ſpirit, &amp;c. Therefore, &amp;c. This is the forme of the Apoſtle his proceeding and diſcourſe in this place. Now touching the words, and the meaning of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is ſaid, <hi>we are the circumciſion,</hi> where the meaning of the Apoſtle is this, we are circumciſed with the true circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28.29.</note> There is then (as the Apoſtle ſhewes) a twofold cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; one outward in the fleſh, which was a cutting of the foreskin of the fleſh, inſtituted by God for a ſigne of the couenant which was made betweene him and <hi>Abraham:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11.</note> another of the heart, in the ſpirit, which is a cutting of from the heart of all carnall affections, whereby we might be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſpirituall ſeruice of God, and in our reioycing in Ieſus Chriſt, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> maketh mention where he ſaith, <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and the heart of thy ſeede, that thou mayeſt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule, that thou mayeſt liue.</hi> That carnall circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was that wherein the falſe Apoſtles gloried, and of which they told the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that except they were ſo circumciſed they could not be ſaued. But that being a ceremonie, which when Chriſt came was aboliſhed, the Apoſtle ſaith plainely, that <hi>that is no circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28.</note> nay he ſaith farther vnto the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.</note> that <hi>if they be circumciſed Christ ſhall profit them nothing.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle calleth them the conciſion, becauſe they cut and rent the peace of the Church by vrging that as neceſſarie to ſaluation, which was aboliſhed, and was now not onely vnprofitable but hurtfull. The other circumciſion which is of the heart, in the ſpirit, made without hands, by putting of the ſinfull bodie of the fleſh through the circumciſion of Chriſt, that is he circumciſion wherein the Apoſtle glorieth, and ſaith, <hi>we are the circumciſion,</hi> .i. we are circumciſed with the true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, that which is outward in the fleſh being no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Againe, where it is added, <hi>which worſhip God in the ſpirit;</hi> by worſhipping God in the ſpirit, he meaneth the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:599:311"/> worſhipping of God: as if he ſhould haue ſaid, we are the circumciſion which worſhip God ſpiritually, not after the outward ceremonies of the law, but in the ſpirit of our minde lifting vp our ſoules vnto him, and reioycing in his holy name. Againe, where hee ſaith, that they reioyce in Ieſus Chriſt, and haue no confidence in the fleſh, he oppoſeth the one againſt the other, and both ſignifieth that the confidence of their ſaluation is onely in Chriſt Ieſus, not in any outward thing, either circumciſion of the fleſh, or what outward thing elſe ſoeuer, and withall implieth t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at they that haue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the circumciſion of the fleſh, or in any outward thing whatſoeuer, and not onely in Chriſt Ieſus, they indeede reioyce not in Chriſt Ieſus as in the borne of their ſaluation. It is then in briefe as if the Apoſtle ſhould thus haue ſaid: I haue warned you to beware of the conciſion, and doe yee beware of the conciſion. The reaſon is: for they who glory that they are the circumciſion are not the circumciſion, but the conciſion, and we are the circumciſion, we are circumciſed with the true circumciſion, we I ſay which worſhip God not after the outward ceremonies of the law, but in the ſpirit, and in truth, and which renouncing all confidence of our ſaluation in the fleſh, or in any outword thing, doe onely reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus as in the horne of our ſaluation. Thus yee ſee the purpoſe of the Apoſtle in this place, what he proueth, how he proueth it, and the meaning of the words. Now let vs ſee what we may obſerue hence for our vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here I note the Apoſtle his elegant alluſion betweene conciſion and circumciſion, where he calleth himſelfe and the <hi>Philippians</hi> the circumciſion, and the falſe teachers the conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by way of alluſion vnto circumciſion whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>I ſay vnto you that no man vnderſtand aboue that which is meete to vnderſtand, but

                     </gap>. Diuers the like might be produced both out of the old Teſtament and likewiſe the new: but let theſe for this time ſuffice. Hence I make this obſeruation, that it is not vnlawfull for the Miniſters and teachers of the word ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to vſe alluſions, and elegancies of ſpeech: for we ſee that the Holy Ghoſt by vſing them ſometimes hath ſanctified the vſe of them. But yet great moderation and diſcretion is to be vſed therein, leſt if we grow to take too great a felicitie and pleaſure therein, we fall into ſuch a ryming vaine and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affectation as is vnbeſeeming the maieſtie of the word, and the grauitie of the Miniſter of the word. That rule of the Apoſtle is by vs diligently to be kept, that no ieſting, or vaine, or light, or fooliſh ſpeech <hi>proceede cut of our mouthes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29.</note> 
                     <hi>but only that which is good to the vſe of edifying, that it may miniſter grace vnto the hearers.</hi> From this obſeruation yee for your vſe may learne, not haſtily to iudge, or preſently to condemne ſuch Miniſters and Preachers of the word as ſometimes vſe alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other elegancies of ſpeech: for yee ſee the Holy Ghoſt doth not altogether auoide them. And albeit ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the moſt plaine and the moſt familiar forme of words be farre the beſt for you, and the moſt to be accepted by you, yet ſometimes ſuch an alluſion, or ſuch an elegancie of ſpeech ſo graceth the ſpeech, as that both it beſt liketh you, and likewiſe maketh the beſt impreſſion in you. In a word, both in the ſpeaker moderation is required that ſuch alluſions or elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be not too often vſed, and in the hearer likewiſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is required, that ſuch alluſions or elegancies be not too raſhly condemned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to be noted that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>for we are the circumciſion.</hi> For thereby both the Apoſtle denieth that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion which is made with hands, and which is outward in the fleſh to be truely circumciſion: and likewiſe affirmeth that ſpirituall circumciſion: which is made without hands by the ſpirit in the heart by purging thence all euill affections to be truely circumciſion; ſo that not they which are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with carnall circumciſion are the circumciſion, but they
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:599:312"/> onely which are circumciſed with ſpirituall circumciſion are the circumciſion. Whence firſt I obſerue, that as all other ceremonies and ſacrifices of the law, ſo likewiſe the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fleſh had then an end when Chriſt came in the fleſh, ſo that the vſe of them afterwards was not onely vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but hurtfull. For albeit it be ſaid both of circumciſion and of other ceremonies,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.14.31.16.</note> and ſacrifices of the law that they were to continue for euer, yet that is ſo to be vnderſtood as that the terme of their continuance was Chriſt his comming in the fleſh: for they being onely ſhadowes of good things to come, when Chriſt which was the bodie figured by thoſe ſhadowes came they had an end, and were aboliſhed, as the Apoſtle ſhewes at large in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrues.</hi> And albeit there were not wanting both of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and of the <hi>Ebionits</hi> and <hi>Cerinthians</hi> that in the Apoſtles time ioyned circumciſion with Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1.28.</note> and vrged it as neceſſarie to ſaluation, yet we ſee that the Apoſtles thought it not meete to burden the Gentiles with circumciſion, or with the law: nay the Apoſtle plainely tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>Galathians,</hi>

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</note> as the Apoſtle witneſſeth. If it had beene a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of the law, it might very well haue beene thought that when the claime of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by the law ceaſed, then the ſeale thereof ſhould likewiſe be aboliſhed. But being the ſeale of the righteouſnes of faith, it may ſeeme that the righteouſneſſe of faith remayning the ſeale thereof ſhould not be aboliſhed. I anſwer, 1. out of the Apoſtle, that he doth not ſimply ſay, that circumciſion was a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, but of the righteouſneſſe
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:599:312"/> of the faith which <hi>Abraham</hi> had when he was vncircumciſed. Now what was the righteouſneſſe of his faith? Surely other then that which is now our righteouſneſſe of faith. For vnto vs it is accounted for righteouſneſſe that we beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt already come in the fleſh, and this is our righteouſneſſe of faith. But vnto him it was accounted for righteouſneſſe that hee beleeued in the promiſed ſeede which ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards come in the fleſh, and this was his righteouſneſſe of faith. Right therefore it was that when the promiſed ſeede which he beleeued came in the fleſh, the ſeale of this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of his faith ſhould be aboliſhed; euen as the ſeales alſo of the righteouſneſſe of our faith ſhall be aboliſhed at his ſecond comming vnto iudgement, when all things ſhall be accompliſhed, and we ſhall ſee him face to face, euen as he is. Againe, vnto the very queſtion it ſelfe, why circumciſion was aboliſhed, I anſwer that it was moſt needfull,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3.</note> becauſe <hi>euery man that is circumciſed, is bound</hi> (as ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to keepe the whole law.</hi> Wherevpon elſe where the Apoſtle calls cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion <hi>a bondage,</hi>

                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4.4.4.5.</note> in which bondage they were kept vntill faith came. But <hi>when the fulnes of time was come, God ſent forth his Sonne made of a woman, &amp; made vnder the law, that he might redeeme all which were vnder the law:</hi> and he tooke all the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and rites that were againſt vs out of the way, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned them on his croſſe. Thus then yee ſee the aboliſhing as of all the ceremonies, &amp; rites, &amp; ſacrifices of the law, ſo of carnall circumciſion after that faith came, that is, after that we began to beleeue in Chriſt Ieſus manifeſted in the fleſh. I know not whether I ſpeake ſo plainely of theſe things as that ye do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me, neither know I how to ſpeake more plainely.

                  <p>If now yee aske me whether circumciſion be quite and vtterly now aboliſhed, ſo that nothing thereof remaineth?

Did he not regard burnt offerings, peace offerings, and meat offerings? Were the ſabboths, and new moones, and feaſt daies ſuch things as in which he tooke no pleaſure at all? No doubt but the Lord had commanded all theſe things whereof the Prophets here ſpeake, in his law giuen by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as might eaſily be proued out of the bookes of <hi>Numbers,</hi> and <hi>Leuiticus.</hi> And this was it that the hypocriticall <hi>Iewes</hi> ſtood vpon with the Prophets, ſaying, that they kept the law of God duely becauſe they obſerued the outward ceremonies &amp; ſacrifices commanded in the law. But this was that that the Lord by his Prophets reproued in them, that they neglected that morall vſe of thoſe things which they ſhould principally haue regarded. They ſtaied themſelues in the outward worſhip of God, and looked not vnto the inward worſhip of him; they obſerued the naked ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, but they regarded not mercy and iudgement, piety and obedience, faith and repentance. Theſe things they ſhould haue done, and not haue left the other vndone. The ceremonie ſhould not haue beene neglected by them, but that inward and more holy worſhip wherevnto by the ceremonie they were led ſhould haue been principally regarded by them. For in this the Lord had more pleaſure then in all burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and ſacrifices what ſoeuer: as it iS ſayd,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 15.22</note> 
                     <hi>to obey is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken is better then the fat of Rams.</hi> And againe the Lord ſaith by his Prophet,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>I deſired mercy and not ſacrifice, and the knowledge of God more then burnt offerings.</hi> Thus then it is plaine, both that the outward ceremonies had a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and more ſpirituall vſe, and likewiſe that this was more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God, euen then when the ceremonie was in vſe, then was the ceremonie though commanded.</p>
                  <p>Now as it was in other ceremonies of the law, ſo was it in this circumciſion of the fleſh, that it had a morall vſe and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, the regard whereof was farre more accepted with God then was the obſeruation of the ceremonie it ſelfe. The morall vſe and ſignification thereof was, to put them in minde
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:599:314"/> of the circumciſion of the heart, that thence they might purge all wicked and carnall affections, ſuch as any way were like to croſſe and hinder their ſpirituall ſeruice and worſhip of God. And as in other ceremonies, when the ceremonie was aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed yet the morall vſe thereof ſtill remained, ſo likewiſe in this, when the outward circumciſion of the fleſh was aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, yet the inward circumciſion of the heart which was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſignified by the outward ceremonie ſtill remained; ſo that as they then were, ſo ſtill wee are to circumciſe the fore-skinnes of our hearts, by cutting away from thence all carnall affections, and vngodly luſts which fight againſt the ſoule. And this was that circumciſion wherein our Apoſtle gloried, when he ſaid, <hi>we are the circumciſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence then 3. I obſerue what that circumciſion is which yet remaineth, and wherein we may and ought to glorie and reioice. The circumciſion which yet remaineth, if yee will haue it in one word, is our regeneration, the waſhing of the new birth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</note> and the renuing of the holy Ghoſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes.

                  </p>
                  <p>Let this, men and brethren, teach vs to deſcend into our ſelues and ſee whether we bee circumciſed or vncircumciſed, whether we can with the Apoſtle truely ſay, <hi>that wee are the circumciſion, that we are circumciſed with the true circumciſion.</hi> Do we worſhip the Lord in the ſpirit with holy worſhippe not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fooliſh fancies of mans braine?

Are our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings inſtructed in the things which are ſpiritually diſcerned? Are our affections enclined to the rule of Gods ſpirit? Are our deſires bent to the things that belong vnto our peace? Are we purged from all carnall affections, and vngodly deſires? Are our lippes faine when we ſing vnto our God? and are our tongues glad when we talke of his righteouſneſſe and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Doe we refraine our feete from euery euill path? and doe we giue our members as weapons of righteouſneſſe vnto God to ſerue him in righteouſneſſe and in holineſſe? If the ſpirit do witneſſe thoſe things vnto our ſpirits, then let vs know that we are circumciſed with the true circumciſion, ſo that wee may
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:599:315"/> ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>We are the circumciſion.</hi> For this is the worke of the ſpirit thus to conſecrate vs to his holy worſhip, thus to ſettle our reioycing on Chriſt Ieſus, and on him alone, thus to teach vs his will, thus to ſanctifie our deſires, thus to purge and cleanſe vs from inordinate affections, thus to make vs veſſells holy vnto the Lord, and thus to guide our feete in to the way of peace. And working thus in vs he doth circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe vs with circumciſion made without hands making vs ne creatures. But if we worſhippe the Lord, ſo that we bowe both to him and <hi>Baal,</hi> if we truſt to be ſaued by our workes, or by any thing but onely by Chriſt Ieſus, and faith in his bloud, if the Goſpell be yet hid vnto vs ſo that we cannot ſauour or per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue the things of the ſpirit of God, if our affections be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate as that we be full of ſtriefe, enuie, hatred, malice, wrath, contentions, backbitings, whiſpering, ſwelling, and diſcorde, if our deſires be ſo vnbridled as that we runne whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the pleaſures of the fleſh, and neuer minde the things of the ſpirit; if as yet we will bee euery one more loth then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to talke of matters of religion, of things belonging to our ſaluation, of the mercies of God in Chriſt Ieſus, and the like; but will ſtraine no curteſie at all to talke filthily, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanly, and vnſeemly, and ſcoffingly, and irreligiouſly, if as yet either we will not open our eares to heare the voice of the charmer charme hee neuer ſo wiſely, or elſe will grinne and gnaſh our teeth at him that ſhall roundly knocke at the doore of our hearts to rowſe vs out of the dead ſleepe of ſinne whereinto we are fallen; if I ſay things ſtand thus with vs, are we not of vncircumciſed hearts, and lippes, and eares? yes my brethren if it be thus whatſoeuer we ſay, or what ſhew ſoeuer we make, yet are we of vncircumciſed hearts, lips, and eares. For therefore is our vnderſtanding full of darkneſſe, our will and deſires peruerſe and crooked, and our affections inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, becauſe the Lord by his ſpirit hath not circumciſed our hearts; therefore are our mouthes filled not with talke of ſuch things as belong vnto our peace, but with corrupt communi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation, and ieſting, and taunting, and profane talking, becauſe the Lord by his ſpirit hath not circumciſed our lippes; and therefore are our eares open vnto euery wicked profanation
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:599:316"/> of Gods name, and euery bad ſuggeſtion of our neighbours, rather then vnto the word of our ſaluation, becauſe the Lord by his ſpirit hath not circumciſed our eares. In one word, are we and walke we as children of diſobedience? it is becauſe the Lord hath not yet regenerated vs by his holy ſpirit, becauſe we yet are not circumciſed with the circumciſion of Chriſt. Let euery man therefore deſcend into his owne heart, and as he doth finde himſelfe, by thus ſearching his heart, and his reynes to be circumciſed, or vncircumciſed, ſo let him thinke himſelfe to be receiued into the couenant, or yet to be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the couenant of promiſe. And hee that is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, let him not gather his vncircumciſion: i. as now I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, let him not defile himſelfe with the corruptions which are in the world through luſt, but hauing eſcaped from the filthineſſe of the world, let him giue his members ſeruants vnto righteouſneſſe in holineſſe, and worſhip the Lord with holy worſhip. But he that hath walked either 40 or 4. yeeres in the wilderneſſe of this life, and is not yet circumciſed, let him know that euen that perſon that is not circumciſed, that man that is not regenerated by the Lord his ſpirit, euen hee ſhall be cut off from the Lord his people, and ſhall haue none inheritance among the Saints of God.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Which worſhippe God in the ſpirit]</hi> By this and the reſt that followes is deſcribed, as I told you who are circumciſed with ſpirituall circumciſion, euen they which worſhip God ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually &amp;c. ſo that hauing ſpoken of ſpirituall circumciſion we haue ſpoken in a generality both of this, and the reſt that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Yet it will not be amiſſe ſomewhat more particularly, yet as briefly as we can, to ſpeake by occaſion of theſe words of the ſpirituall worſhip of God. There is no people ſo farre without God in this world, Iewe, or Gentile, Turke, or other, but that both they know there is a God, and likewiſe thinke they worſhip him with true worſhippe. But how a great many nations and languages ſhould either know the true God, or truely worſhippe him, it can ſcarce be imagined, ſeeing they want the holy word of life, where alone we both clearly know him, and likewiſe how to worſhip him. Nay how ſhould not they moſt groſſely erre touching the true worſhip of God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the word is there are ſo many errors touching the true and ſpirituall worſhip of God. Witneſſe thoſe manifold will-worſhippes of God which men haue deuiſed vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and for which they haue no warrant at all in the word: ſuch as are forbidding of marriage, and forbidding of meates to ſome men at all times, and to all men at ſometimes vnder pretence of holy religion, and deuout ſeruice of God. But for our inſtruction in this point, let vs hence obſerue that not only in the ſpirit of our minde purified by the ſpirit to ſerue him in holineſſe and in righteouſneſſe, but that if we will not erre in the performance of true and ſpirituall worſhippe vnto our God, we muſt proceede by this rule of reioicing in Chriſt Ieſus, inaſmuch as by reioycing in Chriſt Ieſus wee worſhippe God ſpiritually. For what is there required in our ſpirituall worſhip of God which by our reioycing in Chriſt Ieſus is not performed vnto him? Is it not our ſpirituall worſhip of God to loue him, to put our truſt in him, to feare him, to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to obey him, and to glorifie him both in our bodies, and in our ſpirits? And are not all theſe things performed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:599:317"/> him by our reioycing in Chriſt Ieſus? We reioice in Chriſt Ieſus, knowing that in him we are beloued: and therefore we loue God who we know doth loue vs in Chriſt Ieſus. Againe, we reioice in Chriſt Ieſus, knowing that in him all the promiſes of God are yea, and Amen; and therefore we belieue in God &amp; put our truſt in his name who we know for his ſake maketh good all his promiſes vnto vs. Againe we reioice in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, knowing that by him an atonement and reconciliation is made betweene God and vs: and therfore we feare God whoſe wrath we know is now appeaſed towards vs by the mediation of Chriſt Ieſus. Againe, wee reioice in Chriſt Ieſus knowing that by him we may go boldly vnto the throne of grace: and therefore wee poure out our praiers vnto God who wee know giueth vs whatſoeuer wee aske by faith in his name. Againe, wee reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus knowing that through Chriſt wee are able to doe all things: and therefore wee obey God who wee know ſtrengtheneth vs in Chriſt to doe all things that hee requireth of vs. Againe, wee reioyce in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus knowing that hee is made of God vnto vs wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption: and therefore we glorifie GOD both in our bodies and in our ſpirits, who we know hath giuen vs his ſonne, and together with him hath giuen vs all things alſo. So that through the reioycing which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus we worſhip God ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually with all holy worſhip of loue, of faith, of feare, of praier, of obedience, and of glorifying his name both in our bodies and in our ſpirits. Yea and whoſoeuer hath not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in Chriſt Ieſus it is impoſſible that he ſhould worſhip God with this ſpirituall and holy worſhippe. For how ſhall hee loue GOD that is not perſwaded of the loue of God towards him in Chriſt Ieſus? how ſhall hee belieue in God and put his truſt in his name, that knoweth not that all his promiſes are yea and Amen, moſt certaine and ſure in Chriſt Ieſus? How ſhall hee feare God as a dutifull childe that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures not himſelfe of his reconciliation with God by the death and interceſſion of Chriſt Ieſus? How ſhall hee pray vnto. God in faith that knows not that his praiers ſhall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and heard in Chriſt Ieſus, that offereth our praiers vnto
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:599:317"/> God, and makes continuall interceſſion for vs? How ſhall hee obey God in that which he commands that knowes nor that God in Chriſt Ieſus doth enable him to doe that which hee commandeth? How ſhall hee glorifie God in his body, or in his ſpirit, that knowes not what great mercies God hath vouchſafed vnto vs through Chriſt Ieſus? So that vnleſſe wee can reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus euen becauſe wee know all theſe thinges wee cannot poſſiblie worſhippe God with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worſhippe.</p>
                  <p>Will you then, men and brethren, haue a direction for your ſpirituall worſhipping of God? Surely it is needfull,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.24.</note> for God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. Let this then be your direction: Reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus; reioyce in him, becauſe yee are beloued in him, and then ſurely yee will loue God who loues you in Chriſt Ieſus. Reioyce in Chriſt, becauſe in him all Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made good and performed vnto you, and then ſurely yee will beleeue in God, and put your truſt in him, who keepeth promiſe, and ſuffereth not his truth to faile for euer. Reioyce in Chriſt, becauſe by him yee haue receiued the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and then ſurely yee will feare God, whoſe wrath was appeaſed by the reconciliation of Chriſt Ieſus. Reioyce in Chriſt, becauſe through him your praiers are accepted and heard with God, and then ſurely ye will powre out your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God, who giues you whatſoeuer yee aske in faith in his name. Reioice in Chriſt, becauſe in him ye are made able to doe all things, and then ſurely yee will obey God, who ſtrengthneth you in Chriſt to doe all things. Reioice in Chriſt, becauſe by him yee are redeemed, and ſaued, and by the power of his ſpirit ſanctified, and then ſurely yee will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God both in your bodies, and in your ſpirits, who with Chriſt his Sonne giueth you all things both for this life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and likewiſe for that that is to come. So that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a better direction for our ſpirituall worſhip of God, then to reioice in Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe by our reioicing which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus wee are enflamed to loue God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, to put our truſt in him, to feare him, to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to obey him, and to glorifie him both in our bodies
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:599:318"/> and in our ſpirits, which is our ſpirituall worſhipping of God. Whence it is alſo eaſie to gheſſe why it is that wee faile ſo much in the ſpirituall worſhipping of God, which is euen hence, becauſe wee faile in our reioycing in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>For our better inſtruction in which point of our reioycing in Chriſt Ieſus, let vs in the next place hence obſerue, that to reioice in Chriſt Ieſus, is not onely to repoſe our whole truſt and confidence in him, as in the horne of our ſaluation, to make our boaſt of him, and to tell of all the wondrous workes that hee hath done for vs with gladneſſe, but withall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all confidence in the fleſh, and in any outward thing whatſoeuer. For theſe are things which cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reioicing in Chriſt Ieſus, and repoſing our confidence in any outward thing whatſoeuer: for if we reioice in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, then wee repoſe the whole confidence of our ſaluation, and euery part thereof vpon him, and him alone; and if wee repoſe our whole, or any part of the confidence of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on any outward thing, and not on Chriſt Ieſus alone, then we doe not indeed reioice in Chriſt Ieſus. This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle plainly ſheweth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4.</note> where he ſaith, that whoſoeuer are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law, they are fallen from grace; that is, whoſoeuer ſeeke for their righteouſneſſe by the workes of the Law, or hope to be ſaued by them, they are fallen from grace, Chriſt profiteth them nothing. Let them looke vnto this, that truſt vnto their merits, to be ſaued by them. Surely the concluſion from this place of our Apoſtle lieth very hard vpon them. For hence thus I gather: They that haue confidence of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by their merits, or by any outward thing whatſoeuer, and not only by Chriſt Ieſus, they reioice not in Chriſt Ieſus: They that reioice not in Chriſt Ieſus, they worſhip not God in the ſpirit: They that worſhip not God in the ſpirit, they are not circumciſed with the true and ſpirituall circumciſion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they that haue confidence of their ſaluation by their merits, they are not circumciſed with the true and ſpirituall circumciſion. Where in my iudgement the concluſion is as ineuitable as hard. If they anſwer that the Apoſtle maketh no mention of the merit of workes, and therefore nothing can hence be concluded againſt the merit of workes; I anſwer
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:599:318"/> againe, that by the name of fleſh in this place of our Apoſtle is vnderſtood not only the circumciſion of the fleſh, or other ceremonies of the Law, but all the workes of the Law, all mans merits whatſoeuer, euen all outward things whatſoeuer. Which is plaine by the antitheſis and oppoſition in this place betweene Chriſt and the fleſh, and likewiſe by that that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the Apoſtle. For firſt, where he ſaith, <hi>Wee reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus, and haue no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> in that he denieth that they haue any confidence in the fleſh, what elſe is his meaning, but that they haue no confidence in any thing but only in Chriſt Ieſus, ſo reioicing in him, as that they put their whole confidence in him. Againe, when he ſhewes afterwards what he meanes by the fleſh, hee ſpeaketh not only of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the fleſh, but of his tribe, of his ſtocke, of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of his zeale; yea and leſt hee ſhould ſeeme to leaue out any thing without Chriſt wherein he had any confidence, hee ſpeaketh expreſſely of all things without Chriſt, that for Chriſt he counteth all things loſſe. So that the concluſion (though moſt hard) will not be auoided, but that they that truſt to be ſaued by their merits are not circumciſed with the true and ſpirituall circumciſion, but are as yet ſtrangers from the couenant of promiſe, and haue no inheritance among the ſonnes of God.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore, men and brethren, renounce all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in any thing without Chriſt whatſoeuer, and let vs truſt only in the merits of Chriſt Ieſus. He alone is made of God vnto vs wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption: he hath purchaſed vs with his owne bloud: he is ſet for euer at the right hand of the throne of God to make interceſſion for vs; and through him alone we receiue all the bleſſing, that wee haue either for this life, or that that is to come. Let vs therefore reioice in him, and not in any thing without him. Hee that beleeueth in him, beleeueth in him that ſent him; and hee that loueth him, loueth him that ſent him; and hee that obeyeth him, obeyeth him that ſent him; and he that glorifieth him, glorifieth him that ſent him. Let vs therefore worſhip him with all holy worſhip, and ſo ſhall wee worſhip God in the ſpirit, and ſo ſhall we be able truly to
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:599:319"/> ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>We are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and reioice in Chriſt Ieſus, and haue no confidence in the fleſh.</hi>

                  <p>Circumciſe (O Lord) wee beſeech thee the foreskinnes of our hearts with the finger of thy holy ſpirit, that we may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thee in ſpirit and in truth, &amp; that we may reioyce in thy Sonne Chriſt Ieſus as in the horne of our ſaluation, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all confidence in any thing without him whatſoeuer.

<pb n="618" facs="tcp:599:320"/> I might not only as a Chriſtian haue my whole confidence Chriſt, but alſo as a Iew, haue confidence in the fleſh. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, where he ſaith in the next generall propoſition, <hi>If any other man, &amp;c.</hi> the Apoſtle not ambitiouſly, but being forced thereunto by the ambition of others, compareth himſelfe not only with thoſe falſe teachers, but euen with the beſt of the Iewes; and for cauſe of hauing confidence in the fleſh if hee would, he preferreth himſelfe before the beſt of them. For it is as if he ſhould thus haue ſaid: If any, I ſay not only of thoſe dogges and euill workers, but if any other euen of the beſt of the Iewes, thinke that he haue cauſe of confidence in the fleſh, that is, in any outward thing without Chriſt, I might haue more cauſe of confidence in outward things if I would, then he whatſoeuer he be. Thirdly, where he ſaith in the particular recitall of thoſe things wherein he might if hee would reioice, that he was <hi>circumciſed the eighth day,</hi> the Apoſtle ſets downe his firſt prerogatiue common to him with other of the Iewes. He was circumciſed, he meanes in the foreskinne of his fleſh, therefore no Gentile; the eighth day, therefore hee was no proſelyte, but a naturall Iew: for the proſelytes, which were thoſe that being Gentiles embraced the Iewiſh religion, they were circumciſed after their conuerſion vnto Iudaiſme; but all the Iewes were by the Law circumciſed the eighth day. So then he was no Gentile or proſelyte, but a naturall Iew, being circumciſed the eighth day. His ſecond prerogatiue common to him with other of the Iewes likewiſe, was that he was of the kindred of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, not borne of parents that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, and only conuerted vnto Iewes, but of parents which were naturall Iewes, euen of the ſeede of <hi>Iacob.</hi> A prerogatiue which the Iewes ſtood much vpon that they were deſcended of <hi>Iacob</hi> who was called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe he preuailed with God. His third prerogatiue wherein hee was aboue many of the Iewes, was that he was of the tribe of <hi>Beniamin:</hi> which his tribe he mentioneth, both for the dignitie of his tribe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tribe whence <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was; as alſo farther to ſhew himſelfe an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> whoſe cuſtome it was to reckon their tribe. His fourth prerogatiue wherein hee yet more excelled many of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> was that he was an <hi>Ebrew</hi>
                     <pb n="619" facs="tcp:599:320"/> of the <hi>Ebrewes:</hi> whereby hee argues the ancientnes of his ſtocke and linage,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.13.10.21.25.</note> as being continued from <hi>Abraham</hi> called the Ebrew, or from <hi>Eber</hi> of whom the Iewes were called Ebrewes, which was before the confuſion of tongues at the building of Babel. His fifth prerogatiue, wherein he yet more excelled the moſt of the Iewes, was that he was by the law, .i. by ſect and profeſſion a Phariſie,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 26.5.</note> the ſect it ſelfe being thought the moſt ſtrait ſect of the Iewiſh religion, and they more holy, and alſo more learned in the ſcriptures then men of other ſects.

                  <p n="1">1. Here I note the manifold and great arguments which the Apoſtle had of confidence and reioycing in the fleſh, euen ſo many and ſo great, that he might not onely compare with the beſt of the Iewes, but all his prerogatiues conſidered, he might more reioyce in ſuch outward things then might any of the beſt of them. For looke wherein any of the beſt of them might reioyce, whether it were in circumciſion, or in nobleneſſe of race, or in ancient diſcent, or in dignitie of tribe, or in profiting in the Iewiſh religion, therein might he alſo reioyce; and then for zeale, he was much more zealous of the traditions of his fathers then were any of the reſt, being euen madde in zeale againſt the Chriſtians; and likewiſe for holineſſe of life, and religious obſeruation of the law, he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:599:321"/> ſo well and ſo preciſely, as that no man could except againſt him, or reproue him for any thing that way.</p>
                  <p>Hence then I obſerue the wonderfull wiſdome of our good God, in his moſt wiſe diſpoſing and ordering of all thing, for the behoofe and benefit of his Church. For to the end that he might bring the Iewes from that vaine confidence which they had in the fleſh, and from that ouer-weening conceit which they had of their owne righteouſnes by the workes of the law, vnto confidence in Chriſt Ieſus, and vnto that righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is of God through faith, to the end (I ſay) that he might bring the Iewes from thoſe outward things of the fleſh vnto the inward knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, he raiſed vp to this purpoſe this holy Apoſtle, that he being a manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed with all prerogatiues in all ſuch outward thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as they reioyced in, might both be of greater authoritie with them, and likewiſe haue the greater poſſibilitie to draw them from workes vnto grace, from the law vnto Chriſt. For if it had beene ſo, that he had perſwaded them to renounce all confidence in the fleſh, and to reioyce onely in Chriſt Ieſus, hauing himſelfe no cauſe of confidence in the fleſh, they might happily lightly haue eſteemed him, and thought that becauſe himſelfe had nothing touching the fleſh whereof to reioyce, therefore he enuied them, and perſwaded them to renounce all confidence in the fleſh. But when now they ſhould ſee that he that thus perſwaded them was one that had greater cauſe of confidence in the fleſh then had the beſt of them, they muſt needs likewiſe ſee that ſurely his perſwaſions proceeded from a certaine and ſound iudgment, and not from any conceited opinion, or hatefull enuy. So we ſee that to teach men that pleaſures, and ſumptuous buildings, and riches, and poſſeſſions, and the like were all but vanitie and vexation of the ſpirit, he ſtirred vp <hi>Salomon,</hi> who hauing had his fill of all kinde of pleaſures which either his eye,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.</note> or his heart could deſire, and hauing built goodly houſes, and great workes, and hauing gathered great riches and treaſures, and gotten large poſſeſſions aboue all that were before him in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was ſo fit to teach that leſſon, that he ſaying of all thoſe things that they were but vanitie and vexation of the
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:599:321"/> ſpirit, the truth thereof might the rather be beleeued. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when the Church had ſate now a long time in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Romiſh Egypt, and had beene bewitched as with many other groſſe errors, ſo with this of iuſtification by workes, and merits of their owne making, we ſee that to purge the Church of theſe peſtilent diſeaſes, he raiſed vp not many yeares ago in <hi>Germanie</hi> that reuerend <hi>Luther,</hi> who hauing beene a long time more phariſaicall and zealous in thoſe monkiſh waies and doctrines then the common ſort of his order; and hauing liued, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> witneſſeth,<note place="margin">Epiſt. lib. <hi>5.</hi> Melan. l. <hi>6.</hi> Wolſac.</note> ſo that none of all his enemies could euer charge him with any note of iuſt reprehenſion, might ſo much the rather preuaile with the Church to draw them from thoſe dreames and dregs of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and idolatrie wherein they were drowned. And thus oftentimes it ſeemeth good to the wiſdome of our God, to the end that he may the rather draw his people either from errors in opinion, or corruptions in life, to raiſe vp of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſome ſuch as haue as deeply beene drencht in thoſe errors which they maintaine, and delighted aſmuch in thoſe follies which they follow, as they themſelues; that when they ſhall diſclaime ſuch and ſuch errors, or renounce ſuch and ſuch follies, the reſt may the rather hearken vnto them, and be induced by them to diſclaime their errors, and to renounce their follies. Whence I make this double vſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This may teach them whom it hath pleaſed the Lord to reclaime from error in opinion, or folly in life, to conſider why the Lord hath thus in mercy dealt with them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to performe ſuch duties vnto the Lord as are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them. Art thou then called out of the darkneſſe of Romiſh Egypt vnto the glorious light of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt? Art thou freed from the bondage of that Romiſh Pharaoh into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God by the day-ſtarre ariſing in thine heart? It is a great mercy of the Lord vnto thee thus to deliuer thy ſoule from death, and thy feete from ſliding. But conſider thou whether the Lord hath not alſo in wiſdome done this, that thou hauing beene nuſled vp in their ſuperſtitious errors, and as egerly maintained them as they, ſhouldſt now labour to draw them out of darkneſſe
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:599:322"/> into light, and from vaine confidence in the fleſh to reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus. What doeſt thou know but that the Lord therefore ſuffered thee for a while to ſit in darknes and in the ſhadow of death, that when afterward the day-ſtarre ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>riſe in thine heart, thou mighteſt both labour the more with them, and likewiſe be in the better poſſibilitie to preuaile with hem. Follow thou therefore the example of this holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and labour to weyne them as from other their errors, ſo from confidence in their workes, and in merits of their owne making, that they may reioyce wholly in Chriſt Ieſus, and onely put their truſt in his name. Againe, haſt thou haunted with vaine perſons, and beene delighted in the companie of the wicked; haſt thou runne with a theefe when thou ſaweſt him, and beene partaker with the adulterers; haſt thou giuen thy money vnto vſury, or taken reward againſt the innocent; haue thine hands wrought, or thy feete runne vnto, or thy thought deuiſed, or thy heart conſented vnto this or that ſinne or iniquitie; and hath the Lord now reclaimed thee? It is a great mercy of the Lord no doubt vnto thee. But conſider thou whether the Lord hath not alſo in wiſdome done this, that thou mighteſt draw them with whom ſometimes thou ſortedſt thy ſelfe vnto a reformation of their waies. What knoweſt thou but that he hath reclaimed thee from ſuch and ſuch inordinate waies, that hauing walked with them thou mighteſt be the meanes of reforming them. As it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord therefore to reclaime euery man from any error in opinion, or folly in life, ſo let him labour to reforme ſuch errors, or follies in them whom hee knowes to be intangled with them: euer remembring that of our Sauiour vnto <hi>Peter, when thou art conuerted ſtrengthen thy brethren:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32.</note> and likewiſe that, <hi>that he which converteth a ſinner from going aſtray out of his way,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This may teach them that are as yet holden with any error in opinion, or folly in life, to hearken vnto thoſe whom the Lord hath raiſed euen of themſelues to admoniſh them of their errors, or of their follies. For thus they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with themſelues: He was ſo affected as now I am, and
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:599:322"/> had as great skill, and will to maintaine thoſe things which now he doth oppugne, as I haue, and if the Lord haue now reuealed vnto him that which as yet he hath kept hid from mine eyes, who am I that I ſhould not hearken vnto him? Againe, he was ſo delighted as now I am, and did runne after ſuch ſinnes and iniquities as he now ſpeaketh againſt, as now I doe, and if the Lord haue now ſo lightned his eyes that he both ſeeth the folly of his owne waies, and calleth me from the like, why ſhould I not receiue inſtruction from him? Thus (I ſay) they ſhould conſider, and cauſe their eares to hearken vnto wiſdome, and incline their heart vnto vnderſtanding.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.2.</note> But what doe they? Forſooth if ſuch a one as was wrapped in their errors would now draw them from their errors, they diſdaine him the moſt of all other, and they cry away with the Apoſtata, away with the reuolter, we will not heare him, our ſoule loatheth him. And might not the Iewes euen with the very ſame reaſon haue dealt ſo with the Apoſtle, and ſo cried after him. Againe, if ſuch a one as was delighted in their follies whatſoeuer, would now draw them from their follies, doe they not by and by ſay, Oh ſir, how long haue you been of this minde? Are you ſo quickly become ſo preciſe that now you cannot brooke theſe things? Not long ſince you were as we are, and ere long happily will be againe, in the meane time you may talke where you may be heard: but we will walke in our old wayes. And might not the Iewes euen with the very ſame reaſon haue ſaid thus to the Apoſtle? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they that ſend away ſuch as ariſing of themſelues ſeeke to reclaime them from their errors or their follies with ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, they doe therein iuſtifie the Iewes, neither ſuffer they the conſideration of this wiſdome of our God (wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Here I note that the Apoſtle to repreſſe the inſolencie of thoſe that boaſted in outward things without Chriſt, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to ſpeake of ſuch prerogatiues as he had touching the fleſh, and in ſuch to preferre himſelfe before the beſt of them. Whence I obſerue that in ſome caſes the children of God may
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:599:323"/> ſtand vpon their owne commendation, and are not to ſpare to ſpeake of ſuch bleſſings outward or inward as the Lord hath beſtowed vpon them aboue their brethren. Our holy Apoſtle we ſee did it very often. In the lattet to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans chap.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> we ſee how largely he ſpeaketh of the excellency of his miniſterie, of his gifts of knowledge, of his diligence in his office, of the nobleneſſe of his birth, of the auncientnes of his ſtocke, of his patience, of his conſtancie, of his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſufferings for Chriſt his ſake:<note place="margin">12.</note> and in <hi>chap.</hi> 12. of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and reuelations which were ſhewed him of the Lord. So likewiſe in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.2.</note> we ſee how he magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth his office and Apoſtleſhip, ſtanding vpon it that he was in nothing inferior to the chiefe Apoſtles, but withſtood <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle of the Iewes to his face. Where alſo he boaſteth of his profiting in the Iewiſh religion aboue many of his companions,<note place="margin">1.14.</note> and of his zealouſnes of the traditions of his fathers.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 22.26.</note> Like places vnto theſe we haue in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where we ſee the like practiſe of the Apoſtle. But was it that moued the Apoſtle herevnto? Was it ambition, and vaine affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne praiſes that moued him? No ſurely: he was (as himſelfe often ſaith) euen compelled therevnto, partly to repreſſe the inſolencies of thoſe that laboured to vndermine his authoritie; and partly to quit and cleare himſelfe of ſuch falſe caui lations as were laid againſt him; and partly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme ſuch weake brethren, as ſuch arguments of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might ſomewhat preuaile with. Thus then we ſee that the children of God warranted by the example of the Apoſtle may ſpeake euen freely of ſuch bleſſings as the Lord in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards them hath beſtowed vpon them aboue others of their brethren. But may they in euery caſe, and vpon euery occaſion breake forth into their owne praiſes? No certainely they may not, but onely in ſome caſes. As 1. when they are ſo vilified, and diſgraced, and diſcountenanced, their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſo impeached, their gifts ſo nullified, their perſons ſo contemned, as that thereby not onely themſelues are iuſtly offended, but Gods name likewiſe diſhonoured, then may they euen boaſt themſelues of ſuch mercies outward or inward as the Lord hath vouchſafed vnto them. So our Apoſtle did
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:599:323"/> when the falſe Apoſtles laboured to diſgrace him with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> and the <hi>Galathians,</hi> as hauing no authoritie, no gifts of knowledge, or eloquence. 2. When they ſee that the proud inſolencie of their aduerſaries that exalt themſelues againſt the knowledge of God cannot otherwiſe be repreſſed So our Apoſtle did when the falſe Apoſtles did ſo inſolently brag as if they had all knowledge, and all wiſdome, and all vnderſtanding. 3. When they which otherwiſe ſhould giue them that teſtimonie which is due vnto them, doe it not, the glory of God requiring it, then may they breake out into their owne praiſe. And this our Apoſtle ſheweth to be one cauſe why he boaſted himſelfe, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11</note> 
                     <hi>I was a foole to haue boaſted my ſelfe; but yee haue compelled me: for I ought to haue beene commended of you.</hi> Becauſe therefore the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> gaue him not that teſtimonie which was due vnto him, therefore hee was compelled to boaſt himſelfe. 4. When they ſee that their boaſting may make for the edification of the Church of Chriſt Ieſus, then may they boaſt themſelues. So our Apoſtle here boaſteth himſelfe, as to repreſſe thereby the inſolencie of the falſe teachers, ſo partly to teach the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> that ſeeing he, hauing ſuch prerogatiues aboue others touching the fleſh, yet counted all thoſe things but euen dung and loſſe, they alſo by his example ſhould doe ſo. In all theſe caſes the children of God may and ought to ſpeake and euen to glory and boaſt of ſuch bleſſings as God hath beſtowed vpon them aboue their brethren. Touching this whole point I giue theſe two caueats: firſt, that they doe not hunt after occaſions and opportunities to praiſe themſelues, but that then only they doe ſo when they are euen driuen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled ſo to doe by ſuch occaſions as now we haue ſpoken of, or the like: ſecondly, that when they praiſe themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compelled thereunto, they doe it not in affectation of their owne praiſe, but for the praiſe and glory of almightie GOD.</p>

This no doubt was a great and grieuous ſinne to perſecute the Church of God: as our Apoſtle acknowledgeth, where he ſaith, <hi>I was a blaſphemer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.13.</note>

He mentioneth therefore his perſecution of the Church onely to proue that he was as zealous of the law as the beſt of them. Which zeale they highly accounted of, as alſo hee did before his converſion, though now he condemned it.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t the things &amp;c.]</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle goeth forward, and ſhewes, that albeit hee had as good cauſe, and greater of confidence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in the fleſh, and in things without Chriſt then had either thoſe falſe Teachers, or the beſt of the Iewes whatſoeuer, yet now ſince the knowledge of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and his righteouſneſſe was reuealed vnto him, hee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all thoſe outward things in reſpect of any confidence or reioycing in them, not onely as vnprofitable, but as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. In theſe two verſes therefore 1. the Apoſtle in generall ſhewes that howſoeuer ſometimes hee had made great recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his vnrebukable walking in the Law of God, and of thoſe outward things wherein the Iewes gloried, yet after that hee came to the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, hee changed his minde ſo farre, that he counted them then not onely vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but alſo hurtfull for Chriſt his ſake; and this hee doth verſ. 7.2 ſhewing his reſolute continuance in the ſame minde which firſt he had when he came to the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, he doth principally amplifie, and more ſpecially expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that which he had ſaid before in the latter part of the 7. verſe; and this he doth verſe 8. The firſt ye ſee is a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon betweene the Apoſtle his iudgement before his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, and after his knowledge of Chriſt, for the ſame thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which ſeemed a vantage vnto him before he knew Chriſt, afterwards hee counted loſſe for Chriſt his ſake. The
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:599:326"/> ſecond is principally an amplification, or more ſpeciall expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the latter part of the compariſon, where in he goeth ouer and ouer the ſame termes there vſed, but ſometimes with ſome diuerſitie for the farther and better openig of them. For where as verſe 7. hee had ſaid, <hi>the ſame I counted loſſe for Chriſt his ſake,</hi> verſe 8. hee repeateth the ſame to the ſame purpoſe thriſe, but with ſome amplification, and likewiſe with ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the forme and phraſe of ſpeach; as 1. thus <hi>I thinke all things loſſe for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord:</hi> againe thus, <hi>for Chriſt I haue counted all things loſſe;</hi> laſtly thus, <hi>I doe iudge all things to be dung, that I may winne Chriſt.</hi> So that ye ſee the eight verſe is eſpecially an amplification, or more ſpeciall explication of the later part of the compariſon in verſe ſeauen. Now from this generall diuiſion, and expli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation of theſe words, let vs deſcend vnto a more particular examination of the meaning of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine when he ſaith, <hi>the ſame I counted loſſe</hi>] hee meaneth that after he began to know Chriſt hee counted thoſe ſame things not onely vnprofitable, but alſo hurtfull, <hi>for Chriſt his ſake</hi>] i. as the Apoſtle in the next verſe expounds it, for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt Ieſus, or for the winning of Chriſt, becauſe confidence in thoſe things were hinderances hereof. So that it is as if the Apoſtle had thus ſaid: My circumciſion, my kinred, my tribe, my ancient deſcent from <hi>Abraham</hi> the Hebrue, my profeſſion, my zeale, my righteouſneſſe in the law were great things, and things which were in my iudgement before I knew Chriſt ſo meritoriouſly profitable, as that I thought I might repoſe the confidence of my ſaluation in them. But the things, euen theſe great things that were in my iudgement to me before I knew Chriſt adua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>age, i. ſo meritoriouſly profitable as that I thought I might repoſe the
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:599:326"/> confidence of my ſaluation in them; the ſame things I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after that once I began to know Chriſt, loſſe: i. not only no aduantage, but diſaduantage, and hurtfull for Chriſt his ſake, i. for the attaining vnto the perfit knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe confidence in thoſe things is an hinderance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge and winning of Chriſt Ieſus. And did I when firſt I began to know Chriſt count thoſe things not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vnprofitable, but hurtfull, which before my conuerſion ſeemed vnto me ſo profitable as that I might repoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of my ſaluation in them? And doe not I ſo ſtill? yes doubtleſſe: I am not at all altered in my iudgement, but the more that I grow in the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord, the more that I know not his perſon alone, but the infinite treaſures of wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, and ſaluation that are hid in him, the more doe I thinke, not onely all thoſe things wherein I had confidence before I belieued, but abſolutely all things, euen all my workes ſince I belieued, to be but loſſe and hinderances to the attaining of the perfit knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus; for whom, i. for knowing of whom to my comfort, and to repoſe my whole confidence in him, I haue counted all things loſſe, as being drawne by confidence in them from confidence in Chriſt Ieſus: yea and more then ſo I doe iudge not onely all things, wherein I reioyced before I belieued, but euen all my workes whatſoeuer, and whenſoeuer done to bee dung, euen ſtarke naught, and worſe then naught, to this end that I may winne Chriſt, i. that I may be more &amp; more neere ioyned vnto him, the cloake of whoſe righteouſneſſe I know to be the more neare at hand to couer me, the more naked that I am in my ſelfe in my owne iudgement. Not to trouble you longer with the opening of theſe words, in briefe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here teacheth the <hi>Philippians</hi> by his owne example not to repoſe any confidence of their ſaluation in any their works done either before, or after their iuſtification, but onely in Chriſt Ieſus. The reaſon is, becauſe all workes done either before, or after iuſtification are in compariſon of Chriſt, and of any confidence to be repoſed in them, but loſſe and dung. And let thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="632" facs="tcp:599:327"/> hence for our farther vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the things that were vantage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me &amp;c.</hi> I note the great diuerſitie of <hi>Pauls</hi> iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conuerſion, and after his conuerſion vnto Chriſt for the things that ſeemed vantage vnto him before his conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto Chriſt, the ſame things after his conuerſion hee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted loſſe vnto him for Chriſt his ſake. Whence I obſerue the great alteration and change which the ſpirit of God worketh in the heart and vnderſtanding of him whom he vouchſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eth to bring to the knowledge of God in Chriſt Ieſus. For vntill ſuch time as the day-ſpring from on high doe viſit vs, and the day-ſtarre of the ſunne of righteouſneſſe ariſe in our hearts, ſuch blindneſſe, darkneſſe, and ignorance poſſeſſe our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, as that we neither doe nor can perceiue the things of the ſpirit of God, but both wee thinke and ſpeake good of euill, and euill of Good, and iudge that to be vantage which is loſſe, and that to be loſſe which is vantage. This is plaine by that of the Apoſtle where he ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14</note> 
                     <hi>that the naturall man percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the things of the ſpirit of God; for they are fooliſhneſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi> Where by the naturall man hee meaneth the man whoſe heart and vnderſtanding the Lord hath not yet lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his holy ſpirit, who as yet is not brought vnto the true knowledge of Chriſt; and of him he ſaith, <hi>that he neither doth, nor can perceiue the things of the ſpirit of God;</hi> nay more then that, <hi>that the things of Gods ſpirit are meere fooliſhneſſe vnto him.</hi> Yea ſo it fareth ordinarily with the naturall man that he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth darkneſſe for light, and light for darkeneſſe, bitter for ſweete, and ſweete for ſowre. And if any be more carefull of his waies then the reſt, ſo that he can ſay with the Phariſie <hi>I am not as other men, extortioners, vniuſt, adulterers; I faſt twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f hee ſhould not ſaue him for theſe things. But tell him that all theſe, and
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:599:327"/> all the like things are but as a ſtaffe of reede, on which if hee leane it will breake into ſhiuers, and hurt him; tell him that Chriſt Ieſus is the onely rocke of ſaluation vnto all them that put their truſt in him, that there is no other name giuen vnder heauen whereby we can be ſaued but onely by the name of Chriſt Ieſus, and that if he wil be ſaued he muſt repoſe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him, and renounce all confidence in his workes, or in any thing without Chriſt whatſoeuer, hereat he will ſtand amaſed, and with <hi>Feſtus</hi> he will ſay to him that ſhall tell him thus, thou art beſides thy ſelfe, much learning doth make thee madde. Thus it fareth with vs all before ſuch time as we be renued in the ſpirit of our mindes, either wee take pleaſure in vnrighteouſneſſe, or elſe we repoſe too much confidence in our ſuppoſed righteouſneſſe, and for the wiſedome of God we all count it meere fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe. But ſo ſoone as the Lord vouchſafeth by his ſpirit to circumciſe vs with the true circumciſion of Chriſt, ſo ſoone as the Lord giues vs a new heart, and puts a new ſpirit within vs, then we beginne to abandon the delights in the fleſh, and to ſauour the things of the ſpirit, then the caſe beginnes to be altered, and wee to bee quite of another iudgement. For then our eyes which were before dimme and ſhut vp, being opened and cleared, and the foggie miſts of blindneſſe, darkneſſe, and ignorance which couered our vnderſtandings, being expelled, then wee begin to condemne our former waies, then wee beginne to count the things loſſe which before ſeemed a vantage vnto vs, and then we beginne to hearken vnto the things that belong vnto our peace. So that whereas before we had confidence in the fleſh, now we renounce all confidence in the fleſh, and reioice only in Chriſt Ieſus, whereas before wee pleaſed our ſelues much in things which we willed and did; now we ſee that in vs, i. in our fleſh dwelleth no good thing, but that God onely worketh in vs both the will and the deed euen of his good pleaſure, whereas before wee counted the wiſedome of God fooliſhneſſe, now we ſee that our owne wiſedome is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that onely the wiſedome of God is true wiſedome For when the Lord hath put his ſpirit within vs, then we walk in his ſtatutes, and keepe his iudgements, and doe them:<note place="margin">

A great change, and a good change, becauſe from the worſe vnto the better.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs to bend the knees of our ſoules vnto the Lord our God for the grace of his holy ſpirit, that the bright beames of his ſpirit ſhining into our hearts, all miſts of blindneſſe, darkneſſe, and ignorance, may be expelled thence, and wee brought both vnto the perfect knowledge and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt Ieſus. For if he guide vs, wee wander not; if he inſtruct vs, wee erre not; if he command the light of the glorious Goſpell to ſhine vnto vs, then is our darkneſſe turned into light. But otherwiſe our fooliſh hearts are full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, otherwiſe wee erre and wander out of the right way wherein wee ſhould walke, and lay hold on errour in ſtead of truth, and embrace follie in ſtead of wiſdome: for it is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alone that leadeth vs into all truth,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, in that the Apoſtle after that he began to know Chriſt, counted thoſe things no vantage, but loſſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew Chriſt ſeemed vantage vnto him; I obſerue, that ſuch workes as wee doe before wee be iuſtified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, ſeeme they neuer ſo good, yet they are no van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage vnto vs, either vnto iuſtification, or vnto ſaluation. For what were the things that ſeemed vantage vnto the Apoſtle before he knew Chriſt? Was not one of them, and whereof he made ſpeciall account, his vnrebukeable walking in all the commandements and ordinances of the Law, his workes
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:599:328"/> done according to the Law? The verſe immediately before ſheweth that hee counted that one of his chiefe prerogatiues. And yet he counted theſe workes done according to the Law before he beleeued, no vantage at all vnto him for his iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or ſaluation by Chriſt Ieſus. Now if the Apoſtle ſo iudged of his workes done according to the Law before hee beleeued, this may be a ſure proofe vnto vs, that ſuch workes as are done before grace and faith in Chriſt Ieſus, ſeeme they neuer ſo good, yet they are no vantage vnto vs either vnto our iuſtification, or vnto our ſaluation. Well they may haue a ſhew and ſemblance of vantage vnto vs, but indeed they are no vantage vnto vs, either to prepare vs to the grace of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or to moue the Lord to ſhew mercy on vs, and ſaue vs: for without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3.</note> and without the knowledge of Chriſt there is no ſaluation: <hi>for this is eternall life, to know God, and him whom he hath ſent, Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So that our works done before we beleeue, and before we be brought to the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, cannot be any way any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit why we ſhould be iuſtified, or why we ſhould be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs to beware of ſuch deceiuers as tell vs that ſuch workes, though they ſuffice not to ſaluation, yet are acceptable preparatiues to the grace of iuſtification, and ſuch as moue God to mercy. For if they were ſuch preparatiues, or if they did moue God to mercy, how ſhould they not be ſome aduantage vnto vs? which the Apoſtle here plainly denieth. They talke I know of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his praiers and almeſdeeds,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 10.4.</note> as if they had beene workes done before faith, and yet accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God. But the text it ſelfe in that place is ſufficient to confute them: for there it is ſaid, that hee was a deuout man,<note place="margin">2.</note> and one that feared God with all his houſhold, and gaue much almes to the people, and praied vnto God continually. All euident arguments, that as a true proſelyte he beleeued in the Meſſias, howſoeuer he was not yet baptized, nor perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. So that his praiers and his almeſdeeds were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations and diſpoſitions vnto faith and iuſtification, but they were the fruits of his faith and iuſtification already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne. Of the like validitie are whatſoeuer arguments they bring to this purpoſe. Howſoeuer therefore they tell you that
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:599:329"/> workes done before faith or iuſtification are acceptable vnto God, or diſpoſitions vnto grace, or motiues vnto mercy, or merits in congruitie, or whatſoeuer other aduantage, yet yee ſee that the Apoſtle is cleare in the point, that all the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues that any man hath, and all the good workes that any man doth before he know Chriſt, they are no vantage to him at all to iuſtification or ſaluation. Yea further know, that they who make other account of ſuch workes, thereby ſhew that indeed as yet they doe not truly know Chriſt: for this is a plaine teſtimonie that as yet they are not come vnto the true knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, if as yet they count ſuch workes to be a vantage vnto grace, or life. Hearken therefore not vnto them, neither giue ye any place unto their errour.</p>
                  <p>It followeth that hence alſo I ſhould obſerue, that ſuch workes are not only no vantage, but loſſe for Chriſt his ſake. But the generall in the verſe following comprehending this particular, I haue thought good only to ſpeake of it in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and ſo to conclude the point touching workes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly therefore, in that the Apoſtle ſaith in the next verſe, <hi>Yea doubtleſſe I thinke all things but loſſe, &amp;c. and doe iudge them to be dung, &amp;c.</hi> I obſerue that generally all our workes done according to the Law, whether before or after faith and iuſtification, ſeeme they neuer ſo good, by repoſing any confidence of ſaluation in them, are not only no vantage, but loſſe, yea but dung, ſuch as were farre more meet that we ſhould be purged of them, then that wee ſhould repoſe any confidence in them. For that generally all workes are here to be vnderſtood, it is plaine by the Apoſtle in this place: firſt, becauſe hauing ſpoken in the former verſe of workes done before faith and iuſtification, here he vſeth a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall word, compriſing both thoſe and what workes elſe ſoeuer; as if he had ſaid, yea doubtleſſe, now that I am growne vp in further knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, I now thinke not onely things which either I had or did before I knew Chriſt, but euen all things generally, euen all my workes whatſoeuer, and whenſoeuer done, to be but loſſe for the excellent knowledge &amp;c. to be but dung, that I might winne Chriſt. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, that hee doth iudge all things to bee
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:599:329"/> dung, that he might now winne Chriſt. He had already won Chriſt; but his meaning is, that to the end hee might more and more winne him, to the end that hee might more and more neerely be ioyned vnto him, hee counted all his owne righteouſneſſe euen which now he had by any preſent workes of his, to be but loſſe, to be but dung. So that all workes done either before or after that wee be iuſtified by faith, are here meant. What then? are all our workes whatſoeuer, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer done, ſimply to be iudged loſſe and dung? No ſurely, not in reſpect of the ſubſtance of the workes that are done: for faſting, praiers, almeſdeeds, righteouſneſſe, iudgement, mercy, and the like fruits of faith, are good workes, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto God, both commanded and rewarded by him. But both theſe and whatſoeuer our beſt workes are to bee iudged loſſe, and euen dung, that is, in compariſon of the excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, and of that righteouſneſſe which wee haue by faith in him: for what are all things in the world in compariſon of the excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus? or what is mans righteouſneſſe, that it ſhould be compared vnto the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus? Chriſt is our life,<note place="margin">

Surely as darkneſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Sunne in his brightneſſe: for it is as himſelfe, white and ruddie, and wholly delectable, without blemiſh, without ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing: and what elſe is our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> repoſed in them, all our very beſt workes generally whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer are but loſſe, but dung. The reaſon is, becauſe confi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dence in them ſtaies vs from that confidence which we ought
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:599:330"/> to haue in Chriſt Ieſus: for the more that we reioyce and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our ſelues in our owne righteouſneſſe which is by works, the leſſe we care for comming vnto Chriſt to be clad with his righteouſneſſe. Witneſſe the Apoſtle, where ſhewing the cauſe of the ruine of the Iewes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 3.</note> he ſaith that <hi>they being ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God, and going about to ſtabliſh their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, ſubmitted not themſelues vnto the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> Whence it is plaine, that to ſooth vp our ſelues in a conceit of our owne righteouſneſſe, is the very way to ſtay vs from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt Ieſus. And what elſe meaneth that of our Sauiour vnto the <hi>Phariſies,</hi> where he telleth them that the Publicans and harlots ſhall goe before them into the kingdome of God?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 21 31.</note> The meaning is not, that the wicked and lewd life of the Publicans and harlots did more commend them vnto God, then did the religious and ſtrict life of the Phariſies; but thereby our Sauiour giueth them to vnderſtand, that becauſe of their conceit and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their owne righteouſneſſe, they were further from the kingdome of God then were the greateſt ſinners that were ſo that there was more hope of the greateſt ſinners that were that they would ſooner come to repentance, and ſooner come vnto him, then would they that had confidence in their owne workes, and in their owne righteouſneſſe. The more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then that we haue in our owne workes, and in our owne righteouſneſſe, the more ſtrangers wee are from Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe. If wee cleaue wholly to our workes, as thinking to be iuſtified or ſaued by them, wee are wholly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Chriſt Ieſus, and haue no part in that ſaluation which is by grace through faith in his name: or if wee clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Nay I ſay more, if wee cleaue in part vnto our workes, wee haue no part in Chriſt, or in ſaluation by him. Which (I take it) is plaine by that of our Apoſtle, verſe 3. of this chapter, where hee ſaith, <hi>Wee reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                     </gap> ſhould haue confidence in the fleſh, then ſhould wee not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioice in Chriſt Ieſus. The concluſion then muſt needs bee, that all our workes by repoſing confidence in them, how good
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:599:330"/> ſoeuer they ſeeme to be, are indeed loſſe and hurtfull vnto vs. For what more hurtfull then to withhold vs from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto Chriſt? vnto theſe of the Apoſtle let mee adde a 3. reſpect, wherein alſo euen all our workes generally are but loſſe and dung, which is in reſpect of the quality of our works in themſelues. For if our beſt workes ſhould be weighed in the ballance of the ſanctuarie, they would be found too light: if they ſhould be examined after the ſtrict rule of Gods iuſtice they would make vs lift vp our voices with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſay,<note place="margin">

Which doctrine how true, and likewiſe how neceſſary it is, the Apoſtle his inſiſting and beating vpon it doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhew. For ye ſee that the three ſeuerall repetitions hereof taketh vp this whole verſe almoſt.</p>
                  <p>What then? doe we condemne good workes? doe we make this account of them that ſo we may baniſh them out of the country? So ſome tell you: but moſt vntruely. For in all places wee exhort all men that they abound in euery good worke, and we giue all encouragement thereunto. Wee tell you that good workes are the way which God hath ordained that we ſhould walke in vnto heauen, and that without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life no man ſhall ſee the Lord; wee tell you that God commandeth them, that God rewardeth them, that God is well pleaſed with them, and that they are truely good workes, though they be not perfectly good workes: yea wee tell you that they are accounted vnto vs as perfectly good, becauſe whatſoeuer imperfection is in them is for Chriſt his ſake co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:599:331"/> and not imputed vnto vs. Thus wee haue learned, and therefore thus we tell you. Alſo we tell you that yee are not to repoſe any confidence of your ſaluation in them, but all in Chriſt Ieſus, that they are to bee counted but loſſe and dung in compariſon of the excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and of his righteouſneſſe, that our workes be they neuer ſo good doe not make vs righteous before God, that wee are ſaued not of workes, but by grace through faith in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and that none of all our workes can abide the ſeueritie of Gods iudgement, much leſſe merit any grace at Gods hands. Thus alſo we haue learned, and therfore thus alſo we tell you. And doe we condemne good workes, becauſe wee teach you the truth touching good workes? We deſire and we pray that ye may abound in all knowledge, and in euery good worke; but we are iealous that ye ſhould not grow to an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wening conceit of them. Good workes muſt be done, but we muſt not truſt to be iuſtified or ſaued by them, becauſe that honour onely belongeth vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Let this teach vs to renounce all confidence in our owne workes, and in our owne righteouſneſſe whatſoeuer, and to beware of them that tell vs that our workes are meritorious and worthy of heauen. For if wee flatter our ſelues with a proud and phariſaicall conceit of our owne righteouſneſſe by our workes,<note place="margin">

For hee filleth the hung<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, but ſendeth away the rich emptie. Hee came not to cal or to clothe the righteous in their own conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, but he iuſtifieth the wicked, and clotheth the naked. For hee reſpecteth the humble and lowly, but for the proud he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth them a farre off. Let vs therfore humble our ſelues in our ſelues, and only reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus. If we do any thing that is good, it is not of our ſelues, but onely from grace; and if we receiue a reward for any good that we doe, it is not for the merit of the worke, but of the mercie of the Lord: for we muſt ſtill hold that rule of our Sauiour, that when wee haue
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:599:331"/> done all that we can, yet muſt we ſay,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.10.</note>

Or, they which onely doe their duty, what merit they? Surely other merit of any works we know none, but of death. If therefore we will bee made righteous before God, let vs renounce all merit of grace by our owne workes, all confidence in our owne righceouſnes. Let vs abound in euery good worke: but for righteouſneſſe, and ſaluation let vs runne vnto our Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> 
                     <hi>for he is made of God vnto vs wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Let vs be ready to doe good, and to diſtribute, and to procure things honeſt both before God and men, and let vs aſſure our ſelues that a cuppe of cold water giuen in Chriſt his name ſhall not loſe his reward. But let no man ſay in his heart, or thinke with himſelfe that it is for his righteouſneſſe and the merit of his workes. For if he ſo iuſtifie himſelfe, the Lord ſhall condemne him, and iudge him wicked. To ceaſe to doe euill, to learne to doe well, to ſeeke iudgement, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the oppreſſed, to iudge the fatherleſſe, to defend the widow, to faſt, to watch, to pray, to be iuſt, mercifull, and li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berall, to feed the hungrie with our morſells, to cloth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with our fleece, to comfort the ſicke, and to helpe the troubled in their diſtreſſe, are all good workes, odours that ſmell ſweete, ſacrifices acceptable and pleaſant vnto God. Let our faith worke by ſuch loue, and let our knowledge bee filled with ſuch fruits of righteouſneſſe. Such workes God accepteth well at our hands, though he doe not accept vs for our workes, but onely in his well-beloued ſonne Chriſt Ieſus. In a word, let vs alwaies bee occupied in doing that which is good, but let vs not repoſe any confidence of our ſaluation at all in any good that we doe.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing which I obſerue is the reaſon why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle counted all outward things whatſoeuer but loſſe and dung, which was for Chriſt his ſake, for the excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Ieſus, that he might winne Chriſt, and that he might be found in him &amp;c. Here was his vantage, here was his gaine, here was his merit, and for the gaining of this pearle he would willingly ſell or looſe all that euer he had. But I muſt

                  <p>O Lord our God graunt vnto vs we humbly beſeech thee, the grace of thy holy ſpirit, that the bright beames thereof ſhining into our hearts all myſts of blindneſſe, darkneſſe, and ignorance may be expelled thence, and we enabled to ſee the myſteries of thy will, and the wondrous things of thy law.

                  <p>Touching the 1. we muſt vnderſtand that there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold knowledge of Chriſt: One by the law in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; another by the Goſpell in the new Teſtament, and a third in heauen, when we ſhall ſee him face to face. In the law Chriſt was figured by the heauenly Manna, by the Rocke in the wilderneſſe, by the braſen Serpent, by the paſchall lambe, by the rites, and ceremonies, and ſacrifices of the law.

There wee know not his perſon onely, that he is the euerlaſting ſonne of the Father, that he is both God and man, that he is very God of very God, begotten before all worlds, &amp; that he is very man of the ſubſtance of his mother, borne in the world; perfect God, and perfect man, ſubſiſting of a reaſonable ſoule, and humane fleſh: but there alſo we know that he came from the
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:599:333"/> boſome of his father for vs, that he made himſelfe of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant for vs, that in infirmities, and ſorowes, and ſufferings, and affections, and paſſions of the minde, and in all things he was like vnto vs, ſin only excepted, that he might be mercifull vnto vs, that hee humbled himſelfe, and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Croſſe for vs, that he ouercame the powers of death, and roſe againe, and aſcended into heauen for vs, that he hath paied the price for our ſinnes, and freed vs from the bondage of ſinne, death, and the Deuill, that he as our Prieſt liueth for euer, and ſitteth at the right hand of his father to make continuall interceſſion for vs, that he as our King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually protecteth, and preſerueth vs, that hee as our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet by his word, the word of our ſaluation teacheth vs, that in him we are accepted and beloued, that for him Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are ſhowred downe vpon vs, that he is made of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption, that there is no condemnation vnto them that are in Chriſt Ieſus, and that by faith in him, we are made one with him, and he with vs: all this and much more touching Chriſt we know by the glorious light of the Goſpell which hath ſhined in our hearts.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</note> And this is that knowledge which the Apoſtle here calleth the excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Excellent indeed aboue all other knowledge, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent euen as much as our life and ſaluation is worth. And this knowledge of Chriſt is compared by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the day ſtarre.</hi> An excellent knowledge, and ſuch as is ſo much more glorious then the knowledge of Chriſt by the law, as is the light and brightneſſe of the day-ſtarre more glorious then the light and brightneſſe of a candle. The third knowledge of Chriſt is in heauen, when wee ſhall ſee him face to face, which is the moſt excellent knowledge of Chriſt of all the reſt. For then ſhall we ſee him as he is, then ſhall we enioy the continuall fruition of his preſence, then ſhall we ſee the name written vpon his thigh, <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> then ſhall that knowledge which is now onely in part be fully perfited. And this knowledge of Chriſt is compared vnto the Sunne in her brightnes, and
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:599:333"/> is as much more excellent then the ſecond, as the ſecond is then the firſt. Now the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus of which the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh, is not this laſt, nor the firſt know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, but the ſecond, which he calleth excellent, both in it ſelfe, and in reſpect of his firſt knowledge of Chriſt. For he had before a generall and obſcure darke knowledge of Chriſt by the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, being brought vp at the feete of <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> but that was nothing in reſpect of this: this was the excellent knowledge, and for this excellent knowledge ſake he counted both his former knowledge, and all things elſe to be but loſſe and dunge.</p>
                  <p>Now how all things are to be iudged loſſe and dunge for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt Ieſus, that is in the next place to be conſidered. Birth, kinred, nobilitie, wealth, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, knowledge, holineſſe of life, righteouſnes, temperance, ſobriety, and the like; euen all outward things, and all our workes whatſoeuer, are all to be iudged loſſe and dunge for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt Ieſus. What then? Muſt we renounce birth, kinred, nobilitie, and the like? Muſt we make away our wealth and riches, and vow a voluntarie pouertie? Muſt we remit all care of learning and knowledge, and in ſtead thereof imbrace ignorance? Muſt we leaue of to follow after holineſſe of life, righteouſneſſe, temperance, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and the like? Muſt we ceaſe from good workes, if we will be partakers of the excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus? No ſuch matter. <hi>Paul</hi> needed not to renounce his tribe, his kinred, his noble parentage, neither was he to grow diſſolute, or negligent in the obſeruation of the commandements and ordinances of the law, that he might come to the knowledge of Chriſt. His circumciſion was commanded, his tribe and kinred were worthy prerogatiues, and his workes done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law were very commendable. He was not therefore ſimply to renounce, or clearely to abiure all thoſe things, but onely to renounce all confidence in theſe things, if he would be a Chriſtian. Right ſo it is to be ſaid generally. Is any man noble and great by birth and parentage? So were many godly kinges of Iſrael and Iudah. But therein we may

For beſides that they are as a ſtaffe of reede, on which if a man leane it will breake into ſhiuers, and hurt him, confidence in them doth ſtay vs and hinder vs from comming vnto Chriſt, and repoſing that confidence in him which we ought to haue in him. Which is plainely proued by that of the Apoſtle, and that of our Sauiour which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the laſt day.

What was the cauſe why they ſubmitted not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the righteouſneſſe of God? Here it was, they went about to ſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe: they had a great conceit of their owne workes done according to the Law; they thought themſelues righteous by them, and therefore they cared not for comming vnto Chriſt, nor ſought not after the righteouſneſſe of God in him. And this was the very cauſe why our Sauiour told the Phariſies, that the Publicans, and the harlots ſhould goe before them into the kingdome of God. The Phariſies had a proud conceit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat</hi> 21.31.</note> and a very great confidence in their owne righteouſneſſe; inſomuch that they iuſtified themſelues aboue all other men. And therfore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour hereby giues them to vnderſtand that they are farther from the kingdome of God then the greateſt ſinners that are; becauſe there is more hope of the greateſt ſinners that are that they will ſooner come to Chriſt, and ſooner to repentance than thoſe that haue ſuch a conceit of their works, and ſuch a confidence in their owne righteouſneſſe by the workes of the law. Such an enemy vnto Chriſt is confidence in any outward thing without Chriſt. It ſtaies vs from comming vnto Chriſt, from the knowledge of Chriſt, and from confidence in Chriſt Ieſus: for if we ſecure our ſelues, and reſt our ſelues in our ſelues we come not vnto Chriſt, comming not vnto him we know him not, knowing him not we repoſe not the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our ſaluation in him. In reſpect therefore of any confidence to be repoſed in them, we muſt iudge them loſſe and dunge. This qualitie of confidence in them, of truſt to be made righteous by them is that that the Apoſtle diſputes againſt, and that that we muſt quite renounce. Touching all outward things therefore without Chriſt whatſoeuer I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, ſet not your hearts vpon them, ſecure not your ſelues in them, ſet not your affections vpon them, repoſe no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them.

                  <p>What is then the vantage of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus vnto vs? Surely euen as much as our life and ſaluation is worth. For <hi>this is eternall life,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour in his prayer vnto his Father, <hi>to know thee to be the onely very God,</hi>

A notable vantage that this knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus brings vnto vs. But what knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus is it that is this aduantage vnto vs? Not the knowledge of his perſon onely, but what he is made of God vnto vs, which I called before the ſecond knowledge of Chriſt.

It may be ſpoken to the ſhame of this whole Towne, it may be ſpoken to the ſhame of a great many of this congregation, that they loue darkneſſe better than light, that they had rather lie drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ignorance of Chriſt Ieſus, than be taught in the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus; for what frequenting is there by them of thoſe places where they ſhould be taught in this knowledge? Three or foure Sermons may commonly be heard weekely. Of ſo many thouſands as are in this Towne, how many hundreths, nay how many ſcores come to heare them weekely, nay come to heare any of them weekely? If it ſhould be ſaid as it was to <hi>Abraham</hi> at the deſtruction of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>if there be fiftie religious men within the Citie that hearken vnto my voice, and thirſt after the word of their Saluation as the Hart thirſteth after the Brooks, if</hi> 45, <hi>if</hi> 30, <hi>if</hi> 20, <hi>if</hi> 10, <hi>I will ſpare it and remoue from it my ſore plagues of famine, and ſickneſſe,</hi> would we not thinke it a hard matter if ſo many ſhould not be found in this Citie, which might well be as <hi>Goſhen,</hi> where <hi>there ſhould be light though darkeneſſe were round about it?</hi> I ſay not that ſo
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:599:337"/> many cannot be found: for I do not know ſo much. But this I ſay, that too few ſuch there are to be found amongſt vs. In this congregation what ſlackneſſe, and negligence is therein a great many either of frequenting other places, or this? Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the holy Patriarches, and the Prophets deſired that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Ieſus Chriſt, which now ye may haue: and care yee not for it? yea the Angels doe euen yet deſire to looke into it, and will ye not? what is the matter? doth this word of your ſaluation diſtaſte in your mouthes? doe ye not relliſh it? It is a token that ye are ſick; and ye had neede to looke vnto it: for the ſickneſſe is vnto death, euen vnto the ſecond death: Haue ye ſurfeited of it, and had too much of it? quaiſie ſtomackes, and quickly ſurcharged. Soone we haue too much of that whereof we can neuer haue enough. When our Sauiour had told the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that whoſoeuer ſhould drinke of the water that he gaue him, ſhould neuer be more a thirſt; <hi>ſir</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>giue me of the water that I may not thirſt nor come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to draw.</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, againe we tell you, that the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, wherein our hearts deſire is to inſtruct you, is your enterance into the poſſeſſion of eternall life and Saluation, it is as much as your life &amp; Saluation is worth: will you liue the life of God in this life and for euer in the life to come? come then, and learne to know Chriſt Ieſus: come and learne to know what great things he hath done for you, and what duetie againe he doth require of you. If you be rich in this knowledge ye are rich indeed; if ye be inſtructed in this knowledge, ye are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned indeed; if ye be mightie in this knowledge, ye are mightie indeed: If ye haue this, ye want nothing; if ye want this, ye haue nothing.

                     <hi>Of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord.]</hi> What doth the Apoſtle meane to call Ieſus Chriſt his Lord? Was he his Lord alone? Was he not their Lord alſo to whom he wrote? Why doth he not ſay of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord? If hee had liued now, and ſpoken thus, hee ſhould haue had many ſuch queſtions as theſe, and he ſhould haue beene ſure of many ſharpe cenſures for thus appropriating this title of Ieſus Chriſt the Lord vnto himſelfe. But thus he ſpake in the vehemencie of his affection. And if hee had now liued, would hee haue ſpoken otherwiſe? No, though he had beene called Puritan for his paines. I obſerue it the rather, to note what a ſtrange humour wee are now growne vnto: for if any man ſhall now ſay; Forſake mee not O Lord my God, Be mercifull vnto mee O Lord my God, I thanke my God for his mercies, I thinke all things loſſe for the excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord, is hee not nicked in the head by and by, and noted for ſuch a man? Yea now it is almoſt come to paſſe that let a man be religious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout in praier, reuerent in hearing the word, carefull to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate thereon afterwards, one that feareth an oath, one that cannot patiently heare corrupt communication, one that will not runne into the ſame exceſſe with others, a Puritan I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him. A pitifull caſe, that a man ſpeaking as the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh, and doing as all men are commanded to doe, ſhould be branded with an odde and odious name. I wiſh that we would all of vs both frame our ſpeeches as the Holy Ghoſt hath taught vs, and our actions as the Holy Ghoſt hath commanded vs more than we doe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow the Apoſtle goeth on, beating ſtill vpon the ſame reaſon why he counteth all his workes whatſoeuer and whenſoeuer done, and all outward things whatſoeuer to be but loſſe and dung. <hi>I doe iudge them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be dung,</hi> euen contemptible and loathſome, being ſo farre from being loth to loſe them, as that I deſpiſe and loath them: why? that I may winne Chriſt, that is, that I may haue the fruition and the poſſeſſion of Chriſt in this life by faith, and that I may be found in him in that laſt and great day: how found in him? to wit, not hauing mine owne righteouſneſſe, not clothed with mine owne righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:599:339"/> which is of the Law, that is, by the obſeruation and workes of the Law, but being clothed with that righteouſneſſe which is not through workes, but through the faith of Chriſt, euen the righteouſneſſe which is of God through faith, that is, which God doth impute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnto mee through faith in Chriſt Ieſus. So that yee ſee the Apoſtle ſtill runs vpon Chriſt, Chriſt, Chriſt; for Chriſt, for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt, that he may winne Chriſt, that he may be found in Chriſt: he thinkes all his workes, all things abſolutely to be loſſe, and iudgeth them to be dung. <hi>I iudge them to be dung.</hi> Here he plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth all confidence in all things without Chriſt whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, and plainly diſclaimeth all vantage, all merit, all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by his workes. <hi>That I may winne Chriſt:</hi> Here is the cauſe why he diſclaimes all righteouſneſſe by his workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe he could not winne Chriſt; for he doth it that he may winne Chriſt, and may be found in him. This alſo is a part of the cauſe why hee diſclaimes all righteouſneſſe by his workes, becauſe otherwiſe he could not be found in Chriſt in that day. Why not? What is it to be found in Chriſt? The Apoſtle ſhewes that to be found in Chriſt, is to bee found not clothed with his owne righteouſneſſe which is by the workes of the Law, but clothed with that righteouſneſſe which is Chriſts, and only ours through faith in Chriſt, euen that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which God doth impute vnto vs through faith in his name. So that he that will be found in Chriſt in that day, muſt diſclaime his owne righteouſneſſe, and renounce it as dung and rottenneſſe, and muſt cleaue onely vnto the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, which God doth impute vnto him through faith in him. The ſumme then of that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tels the <hi>Philippians</hi> in theſe words, is, that hee now at this preſent in the ſtate wherein hee now ſtands, doth iudge all things, euen his very beſt preſent workes, to be ſo farre from any part of his righteouſneſſe, as that he iudgeth them to bee dung, euen vile and contemptible, ſo that hee doth diſclaime all righteouſneſſe by them, that he may winne Chriſt, that is, that he may be more and more neerely incorporated into him, and poſſeſſed of his righteouſneſſe by faith, and that hee may be found in that laſt and great day not in <hi>Moſes,</hi> but in
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:599:339"/> Chriſt, that is, not hauing his owne righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, as his garment to ſtand before the Lord withall, but hauing that righteouſneſſe to be clothed with which is indeed Chriſts, and his through the faith of Chriſt, euen that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which God doth impute vnto him through faith in Chriſt his name. This, I ſay, I take to be the ſumme of that which the Apoſtle tels the <hi>Philippians</hi> in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>So that yee ſee here is firſt a diſclaiming of his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by workes, in that he iudgeth them to be dung: 2. A reaſon why hee ſo iudgeth them, and ſo diſclaimes them, that he may winne Chriſt, and may be found in him: thirdly, an explication what it is to be found in Chriſt, by a diſtinction of righteouſneſſe, into his owne, and Chriſts, where hee ſaith, <hi>not hauing mine owne, &amp;c.</hi> Now let vs ſee what obſeruations may hence be gathered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is not vnworthy our noting, that the Apoſtle goeth ouer and ouer theſe points ſo often, as if he could neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelfe with diſclaiming all righteouſneſſe by any works, and proclaiming Chriſt alone to be all his righteouſneſſe. In the former verſe hee diſclaimeth all his workes done before his conuerſion, as no vantage, but loſſe vnto him, and maketh Chriſt all his vantage either for righteouſneſſe or ſaluation. In this verſe three ſeuerall times he diſclaimeth all his workes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, whether done before or after his conuerſion, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching any righteouſneſſe by them; and againe ſo many times auoucheth in effect Chriſt Ieſus alone to bee all his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Whence I obſerue both the difficultie, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſitie of enforcing theſe points. A difficult and hard matter it is when we haue done any thing well, when we haue walked faithfully in our calling, when we haue releiued the oppreſſed, iudged the father-leſſe, defended the widow, when wee haue humbled our ſelues in praier, chaſtened our ſelues with faſting, abſteined from the delights of the world, or pleaſures of the fleſh &amp;c. a difficult and hard matter, I ſay, it is herein not to pleaſe our ſelues, not ſomewhat to be puffed vp with theſe things, not to haue ſome conceit of merit and righteouſneſſe by theſe things. A difficult matter to perſwade vs that theſe things are no vantage vnto vs vnto iuſtification or ſaluation.
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:599:340"/> A difficult matter to perſwade vs that theſe things are but loſſe and dung, things vile and contemptible. And yet neceſſarie it is that we be thus perſwaded of theſe and the like things as touching any confidence of our righteouſneſſe or ſaluation by them, and that we count Chriſt alone all our righteouſneſſe, and the horne of our ſaluation. And therefore the Apoſtle knowing both the difficultie, and yet the neceſſitie of perſwading this, beateth vpon it twiſe, thriſe, often, that he did thus and thus, and therefore the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould doe ſo.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould teach vs with great diligence to obſerue and marke the things that are ſo much and ſo often beaten vpon, as things which either we are dull to comprehend, or vnwilling to yeeld vnto, and yet things which are as moſt certaine for their truth, ſo moſt neceſſarie for their vſe: for albeit all the things in the whole booke of God be of ſuch importance as that they are moſt worthie of our due meditation and diligent obſeruation, as able to make vs wiſe vnto ſaluation, yet when things are ſo much vrged, and ſo often beaten vpon, we are to thinke that it is not without great cauſe that they are ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and therefore that they are with greater attention and heedfulneſſe to be marked by vs. As therefore we are with all diligence to obſerue whatſoeuer is written, becauſe all things are written for our learning, ſo let vs with all diligence obſerue the things ſo often vrged. It may be that they are ſo often vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged becauſe of our dulneſſe to comprehend them, it may be becauſe of our vnwillingneſſe to yeeld vnto them, it may be becauſe of the vnfeined aſſent that we ſhould yeeld vnto the truth of them, it may be becauſe of the neceſſarie vſe that there is of them. Surely they are not ſo much vrged without great and vrgent cauſe. And ſo for theſe points heere beaten vpon, let vs aſſure our ſelues both that it is moſt true that our works are no part of our righteouſneſſe, but Chriſt our whole righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and that it neceſſarily behooueth vs to be throughly perſwaded thereof. How good ſoeuer therefore our workes ſeeme vnto vs, and how difficult ſoeuer it be to perſwade vs that our very beſt workes are to be iudged but loſſe and dung, yet ſeeing the Apoſtle ſo often tels vs that he iudged ſo of his
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:599:340"/> beſt workes, let there be the ſame minde in vs that was in him, and let vs iudge ſo to.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>and doe iudge them to be dunge,</hi> I note the Apoſtles preſent iudgement of his preſent workes. He now at this preſent in the ſtate wherein he now ſtands doth iudge all things euen his very beſt preſent workes to bee ſo farre from being any part of his righteouſneſſe, as that hee iudgeth them to be dung, euen vile and contemptible, ſo full of pollution and vncleaneſſe as that there is no reckoning to be made of them in reſpect of any righteouſneſſe by them, but rather they are to be contemned as vncleaneſſe. Whence I obſerue that our very beſt workes, ſuch as are wrought after our knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, and faith in his name, are no part of that righteouſneſſe whereby we are accounted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God. Great difference I know there is betweene the workes which go before, and the workes which follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faith. For thoſe are euill, theſe are good workes, thoſe proceede from an impure heart, theſe from an heart purified by faith, thoſe cannot pleaſe God, theſe are pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God, thoſe are in iuſtice rewarded with death, theſe are in mercy rewarded with life, thoſe, euen the very beſt of them haue the nature of ſinne, and are wholly vnholy, theſe are in part holy, and may truely be called our inherent righteouſneſſe. But for any part in that righteouſnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are made righteous before God euen theſe workes which are the fruits of faith, they haue no part at all in it. They cannot hide or put away our ſinnes, they cannot endure the ſeueritie of Gods iudgement: here they muſt giue place, here they are to be iudged loſſe and dung. The reaſon then why our very beſt workes are no part of our righteouſneſſe before God is, becauſe that in euery ſuch view and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them they are to be iudged loſſe, and euen dung. So the Apoſtle counted ſuch workes as he did euen then when he wrote theſe things: and therefore much more are we to make the ſame account of whatſoeuer good workes we doe after that our hearts be purified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>The exception which is taken againſt this doctrine from this place by ſome is this, they ſay the Apoſtle doth not here
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:599:341"/> ſpeake of ſuch workes as he did after he belieued, but onely of ſuch workes as he did before he belieued, before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion vnto Chriſt; and therefore that hence nothing can be gathered againſt iuſtification by workes done after faith in Chriſt Ieſus. But how peruerſly they falſifie the meaning of the Apoſtle your ſelues may eaſily iudge by that which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath beene ſpoken. For the Apoſtle hauing ſpoken in the former verſe of ſuch workes as he did before he belieued, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of them that howſoeuer they ſeemed vantage vnto him before his conuerſion vnto Chriſt, yet afterwards hee counted them no vantage, but loſſe for Chriſt his ſake; doth in this verſe ſpeake not onely of them, but of all his workes generally whatſoeuer and whenſoeuer done, ſaying, <hi>yea doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I thinke all things but loſſe &amp;c.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that he ſpake in the former verſe of ſuch works as he did before he belieued. And when he addeth vnto that this generall terme, yea doubtleſſe I thinke all things but loſſe, doth he ſpeak on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch workes as he did before? Nay hauing ſpoken before of workes onely done before faith, in this generall tearm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he includeth all workes both done before and after faith, and iudgeth them all to be but loſſe and dung. Againe, as he ſaid before that when once he came to the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus he counted thoſe things loſſe which before ſeemed van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage vnto him; ſo now he ſaith in the preſent that hee doth thinke all things but loſſe, that he doth iudge all things to bee dung. Which cannot otherwiſe be meant then of his preſent opinion and iudgement touching ſuch workes as now preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did. Neither can it be ſaid that is his preſent iudgement indeed, but of ſuch workes only as he did before he belieued. For it is, as himſelfe ſaith, his preſent iudgement as of ſuch workes, ſo of all workes generally, the generall tearme being therefore added to compriſe not onely thoſe which hee had ſpoken of before, but all others alſo. For reply vnto which anſwere they crie out vpon vs for blaſphemie, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon queſtion to make ſome ſhew that they iuſtly charge vs with blaſphemie. For whereas we ſay that good workes done after faith are here meant by the Apoſtle, and are iudged by him to be but loſſe and dung, they aske whether we call the
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:599:341"/> fruits of the ſpirit dung? whether <hi>Paul</hi> gloried of dung when he ſaid, <hi>I haue fought a good fight, I haue finiſhed my courſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>I haue kept the faith; from henceforth there is laid vp for me a crowne of righteouſneſſe which the iuſt iudge ſhall giue me in that day?</hi> What crown of righteouſneſſe is due vnto dung? what iuſt iudge will vouchſafe to giue a crowne vnto dung? what thankes wee owe vnto God for creating vs in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good works if they be nothing elſe but dung? And for concluſion they ſay that if the good workes of the faithfull be but loſſe and dung, then are not good workes to be done or liked, but to be diſliked and neglected. Thus they triumph in their iuglings, and make a ſhew as if all they ſpake were Goſpell, &amp; whoſoeuer ſaid otherwiſe did nothing elſe but blaſpheme. But will ye ſee how they deceiue the world with a vaine ſhew of words wherein there is no ſubſtance. All this faire flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh which they make is quickly beaten downe by that one diſtinction whereof I haue often told you, and whereof they are not ignorant. In good workes therefore we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that there are 2. things to be reſpected; the one their ſubſtance, the other their qualitie. The ſubſtance of the work I call the action it ſelfe, is iudging the fatherleſſe, relieuing the oppreſſed, defending the widow, feeding the hungrie, and the like. The qualitie of the worke I call the confidence which men haue to be made righteous before God, and to be ſaued by ſuch workes. Now theſe workes I ſay according to their ſubſtance are good, as to iudge the fatherleſſe, to relieue the oppreſſed, to defend the widow, to feed the hungrie and the like, are good workes, holy workes, workes commanded by God, and workes rewarded by him. But in reſpect of any confidence to be iuſtified before God by them or the like, or to be ſaued by them, they are to be iudged but loſſe and dung, becauſe, as it is written, <hi>he that reioyceth muſt reioice in the Lord,</hi> which being ſo, the anſwere to their demands is as poſſible, as they thinke it impoſſible, i. moſt eaſie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Therefore where they aske, whether we call the fruits of the ſpirit dung? we anſwere, no. But we ſay that thoſe good workes which according to the ſubſtance of the action are the fruits of the ſpirit are in reſpect of any merit, or confidence to
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:599:342"/> be repoſed in them of righteouſneſſe or ſaluation by them to be iudged loſſe and dung. Secondly, where they aske whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi> gloried of dung, when he ſaid, I haue fought a good fight &amp;c. we anſwere no. He glorieth in his faithfulneſſe and conſtancie in the worke of his miniſterie, not as putting any confidence of his righteouſneſſe or ſaluation in them: (for ſo they ſhould be but dung) but becauſe he knew that his labour ſhould not be in vaine in the Lord. Thirdly, where they aske, what crowne of righteouſneſſe is due vnto dung? we anſwere, none: for the crowne of righteouſneſſe is due vnto our good workes, not as they are from vs, but as they are the worke of Gods ſpirit in vs, neither ſo for any merit in them, but only for his promiſe ſake, who both worketh in vs, and crowneth his one workes in vs. Fourthly, where they aske, what iuſt iudge will vouchſafe to giue a crowne vnto dung? we anſwere, none will doe it: But the moſt righteous iudge, the Lord of heauen and earth, becauſe he is righteous and keepeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for euer, giueth a crowne vnto our good workes, not as they are dung, not as they are poiſoned tempered with that qualitie of confidence in them, but as they are the worke of his ſpirit in vs. 5. Where they aske, what thanks we owe vnto God for creating vs vnto good workes, if they be nothing elſe but dung? we anſwer that it is their ſhamefull abuſing of the world to ſay that we iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be nothing elſe but dung. In reſpect of that qualitie we ſay that they are to be iudged loſſe &amp; dung, but in reſpect of their ſubſtance we ſay that they are good, and that we are to glorifie God by walking in ſuch good works as he hath ordeined vs to walke in. Laſtly, where they ſay, that if the good workes of the faithfull be but loſſe and dung, then are not good workes to be done or liked, but to be diſliked &amp; neglected, we ſay the ſame. But who are they that ſay that the good workes of the faithfull are nothing elſe but loſſe and dung? Becauſe we do not inueſt them into the glory of Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe wee doe not make them any part of our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe before God, becauſe we ſtand not vpon any merit of ſaluation by them, doe we therefore ſay that they are nothing elſe but loſſe and dung? Thus indeed they beare the world in hand, and thus they lead captiue many poore and ignorant

But marke men and brethren what it is that we ſay: we ſay that good works in reſpect of the ſubſtance of the action are good works, a ſweet ſmelling odor, a ſacrifice acceptable and pleaſing vnto God, and ſuch as God hath ordeined vs to walke in vnto life and ſaluation; only in reſpect of any merit or confidence of righteouſneſſe or ſaluation we ſay they are to be iudged but loſſe and dung. See then and iudge betweene vs and them, whether we ſay ſimply that they are but loſſe and dung. Theſe are they that with fained words make marchandize of your ſoules, whoſe iudgement long agone is not farre of, and whoſe damnation ſleepeth not.

Let vs therefore abound in euery good worke that we may haue the teſtimonie of our faith, and of our iuſtification ſealed vp vnto our ſoules. But let vs not ſo pleaſe our ſelues in all the good that we do as that we count our ſelues righteous thereby:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam</hi> 3.2.2.10.</note> for in many things we ſinne all: and he that faileth in one point of the law, he is guiltie of all.

It is moſt damnable pride that makes vs ruſh into part with Chriſt, and to part ſtakes with him. Let vs therefore with the Apoſtle make Chriſt all our righteouſneſſe, and account our owne righteouſnes which is by works to be but loſſe &amp; dung, and no vantage at all either vnto iuſtification, or ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that the Appoſtle ſaith, that he iudgeth them to be dung that he may winne Chriſt: I note the reaſon why he iudgeth all things to be dung, which is, that he might win Chriſt, as if he ſhould ſay, that vnleſſe he iudged all things to be dung, hee could not winne Chriſt, hee could not be throughly engraffed into Chriſt to be partaker of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. Whence I obſerue that either we muſt diſclaime all righteouſneſſe by any workes of our owne, or elſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pertakers of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, either we muſt iudge our owne workes whatſoeuer to be loſſe and dung, or elſe we cannot winne Chriſt. This alſo the Apoſtle ſheweth in another place, where he ſaith, that <hi>vnto him that worketh not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>but beleeueth in him that iuſtifieth the vngodly his faith is counted for his righteouſneſſe:</hi> to him that worketh not .i. to him that dependeth not on his workes, to him that ſtandeth not vpon the merits of his workes, to him that make not his workes his righteouſneſſe, to him his faith is counted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:599:343"/> But to him that worketh, the wages is not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by fauour, but by debt: to him that worketh, that is to him that dependeth on his workes, that ſtandeth vpon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his workes, and thinkes to be iuſtified by them, his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is not counted by fauour, but by debt, and is not iuſtified by grace through faith. Who then are iuſtified by faith? euen they that diſclaime righteouſneſſe by workes. And who are they that are not iuſtified by grace through faith? euen they that ſtand vpon their righteouſneſſe by their workes. Wilt thou be pertaker of Chriſt his righteouſneſſe by faith? thou muſt diſclaime all righteouſneſſe by thy workes. Wilt thou ſtand vpon thy righteouſneſſe by thy works? thou canſt not be pertaker of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith: For there is no communion or fellowſhip betwixt them, but as the Apoſtle ſaith of the election of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſo I ſay of our iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus: if we be perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſt his righteouſneſſe, <hi>if we be iuſtified by grace,</hi>

                     <hi>then not of workes, or elſe were grace no more grace; but if of workes, it is no more grace, or elſe were worke no more worke.</hi> Wee muſt therefore diſclaime all righteouſneſſe by workes, if we will lay any claime vnto righteouſneſſe by Chriſt, we muſt iudge all our workes to be loſſe and dung if we will winne Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs to beat downe euery thought and euery imagination of our hearts that exalteth it ſelfe againſt God, and to bring into captiuitie euery thought vnto the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt. Let vs not thinke of the beſt workes that we doe aboue that is meet, neither let vs beare our ſelues vpon them aboue that wee ought.

We cannot lay any claime vnto Chriſt his righteouſneſſe, vnleſſe we will diſclaime our owne righteouſneſſe. Let vs therefore humble our ſelues before God, let vs acknowledge our ſelues to be ſinners, and the beſt things that wee doe to be ſo full of pollutions and imperfections, that they cannot poſſibly abide the triall of Gods iudgement. And ſeeing wee cannot winne Chriſt, and be partakers of his righteouſneſſe, vnleſſe we iudge
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:599:344"/> all things without him to be but loſſe and dung, let vs with the Apoſtle iudge them to be dung, that wee may win Chriſt; let vs diſclaime all righteouſneſſe by them, that wee may bee clad with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. So ſhall our vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe be hid, and our ſinnes couered, and whatſoeuer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection is in vs, it ſhall not be imputed vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in that he addeth, <hi>and may be found in him,</hi> I note that another branch of his reaſon why hee iudgeth all things, and ſo all his workes to be dung, is, that he might be found in Chriſt, that is, that when God ſhall come to iudge both the quicke and the dead, and enquirie ſhall be made what euery man hath done in his body, hee may be found in Chriſt, not in <hi>Moſes,</hi> not in the fleſh, not in any thing but in Chriſt.

And euen ſo, he that will be found in Chriſt in that day, he muſt ſo reioice in Chriſt alone, as that he haue confidence in nothing elſe, but iudge them all to be loſſe and dung.

                  <p>Let this alſo be another motiue vnto vs to diſclaime all righteouſneſſe by our workes: for as there is no righteouſneſſe by faith vnto him that claimeth righteouſneſſe by his workes, as before wee heard; ſo is there no ſaluation in that day vnto

                  <p>Whence I obſerue, that if iuſtification be by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of workes, then is it not by the righteouſneſſe of faith; and if it be by the righteouſneſſe of faith, then is it not by the righteouſneſſe of workes. Thus alſo our Apoſtle vpon the ſame ground reaſoneth in his epiſtle to the <hi>Romans:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.21.27.</note> for hauing in the third chapter plainly diſtinguiſhed righteouſneſſe by the workes of the Law, and righteouſneſſe of God by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and oppoſed reioycing in the one vnto reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the other, in the next chapter hee taketh vp the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull, and prouing that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified by faith, and not by workes, he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his diſputation thus: <hi>If Abraham</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were iuſtified by workes, he hath wherein to reioyce, but not with God;</hi> hee hath wherein to reioyce, to wit, with men, but not with God Which is in effect as if he ſhould haue ſaid, If <hi>Abraham</hi> were iuſtified by workes, then was he not iuſtified by faith. Againe, that place in the eleuenth chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> is plaine to this purpoſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>If it be of grace,</hi>

                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4.</note> for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer are iuſtified by the Law, yee are fallen from grace.</hi> As if he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that yee ſee plainly that if our iuſtification be by the righteouſneſſe of workes, then is it not by the righteouſneſſe of faith; and if it be by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith, then is it not by the righteouſneſſe of works.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerue to inſtruct and to arme vs againſt their damnable errour, that tell vs that we are iuſtified and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteous before God partly by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and partly by our good workes done here in the body. For if they may be thus mixt, as they tell vs, the one with the other, if our righteouſneſſe before God may be both by faith, and by workes, then why doth the Apoſtle ſo oppoſe the one againſt the other? why doth hee alwayes ſo carefully ſeuer the one from the other? why would hee be found in that day not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his owne righteouſneſſe, but onely the righteouſneſſe which is through the faith of Chriſt? why may not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be counted both by fauour, and by debt? why may not righteouſneſſe be before God both by grace and by workes? why ſhould our reioicing be excluded by the law of faith? For what elſe are all theſe things but ſo many inuincible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that wee cannot be iuſtified before God both by faith and by workes? Shifts I know they haue whereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themſelues, and many other vnſtable ſoules, whom they leade into the ſame pernicious errours with themſelues. But let vs hearken what the ſpirit ſaith; neither let vs couple toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther the things which the ſpirit hath ſundred. If the ſpirit haue told vs, that the wages is not counted both by fauour and by debt, that righteouſneſſe is not both by grace and by workes, let it ſuffice vs that the ſpirit hath ſaid ſo, and only let vs ſeeke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hether it be by grace or by workes that we are counted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I note that the Apoſtle would be found in that laſt and great day not hauing his owne righteouſneſſe which
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:599:347"/> is of the Law, that is, not hauing that righteouſneſſe which is his by the performance of thoſe things which the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as his cloke to be couered withall when hee ſhall ſtand in the iudgement, and in the congregation of the righteous. For that the Apoſtle expoundeth to be the righteouſneſſe of the Law, which is by performance of the workes of the Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5 <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.</note>

The Apoſtle would bee found not hauing this righteouſneſſe which is by the workes of the Law. What then? would he be found in that day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any good workes, without all holineſſe of life, without all righteouſneſſe by the Law? Was it his deſire to be found a ſinner in that day? Did hee thinke it would be better for him if he ſhould be found vnrighteous, then if he ſhould be found righteous in that day? No ſuch matter. Nay when he was now ready to be offered vp vpon the ſacrifice and ſeruice of their faith whom he had wonne vnto the faith, when the time of his departing out of the body was at hand, hee reioyced that hee had fought a good fight, that hee had finiſhed his courſe, that he had kept the faith. And when hee laboured in the worke of his miniſterie more abundantly then all the reſt, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto his reioycing in the day of Chriſt, that he had not runne in vaine, nor laboured in vaine.

<pb n="674" facs="tcp:599:348"/> the law? 1. for righteouſneſſe by the ceremoniall law he cared not at all for that, he iudged that ſimply to be but loſſe, to be but dung. 2. for righteouſnes by the morall law, by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the duties commanded in the firſt and ſecond table touching the loue of God, and of his neighbour, he iudged that alſo to be dung in reſpect of any merit if hee ſhould bee iudged by it. He would therefore be found in that day not hauing his owne righteouſnes which is of the Law, euen of the law morall, as to be iudged of the Lord by it, by the merit of it. He would haue righteouſnes, and holineſſe, and good workes in that day, that in the iudgement he might receiue reward according to them; but he would not haue them to be iudged by them in that day, to offer them in that day vnto Chriſt as a due deſert of his Maſters ioy, to receiue his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for them in that day.</p>
                  <p>Hauing then before ſeene that we cannot be accounted righteous before God both by faith, and by workes, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if then we ſhall be found to haue hated iniquity, to haue followed after peace, holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, to haue had our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation honeſt &amp;c. The moſt righteous Iudge both of heauen and earth he will paſſe by our ſinnes and iniquities, and in his great mercy towards vs he will reward vs according to the good that we haue done; not reſpecting the merit of our workes, but becauſe he is mercifull, and keepeth promiſe for euer, nor ſuffering our labour to be in vaine in the Lord. We are therefore to deſire to be found in that day not without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life, or good-worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But we are to deſire to be found in that day not hauing our owne righteouſnes to be iudged by it, or to receiue reward for it, or according to the merit and worth of it. For albeit it ſhalbe rewarded, yet ſhall not the reward be giuen for it; and albeit the reward ſhall be giuen according to it, yet not for the merit of the worke, but onely for his promiſe and mercies ſake who accepteth that graciouſly which is his, and pardoneth that graciouſly which is amiſſe. For all that euer we do, or all that
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:599:349"/> euer we ſuffer is not worthy of that glory which ſhalbe ſhewed vnto vs. But with the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> we muſt turne our voice vnto the Lord, and ſay euen of our beſt righteouſneſſe, <hi>If thou O Lord ſtraightly marke what is amiſſe, euen in the beſt thing that we doe, O Lord who ſhall ſtand?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The; thing which I note is, that the Apoſtle would bee found in that laſt and great day hauing that righteouſneſſe which is through the faith of Chriſt &amp;c. he would be clothed in that day with Chriſt his righteouſneſſe imputed vnto him by God through faith, that he might be iudged by it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his reward according to the merit of it. This righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſometimes called the righteouſneſſe of faith, becauſe by faith in Chriſt we are made partakers of this righteouſnes; ſometime the righteouſneſſe of God, becauſe it is the meere gift of God, who doth impute it vnto vs through faith in Chriſt; ſometimes the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, becauſe it is his, and onely inherent in him. Hee would be found in that day hauing this righteouſneſſe. Hence then I obſerue, that the righteouſneſſe whereby wee are accounted righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, or of faith, or of God, which ſoeuer ye will make it. This alſo the Apoſtle hath euery where:<note place="margin">

This then is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes before God, that God through faith in Chriſt Ieſus imputeth not our ſins vnto vs, but imputeth Chriſt his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe vnto vs, reckoning the righteouſneſſe of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the Law vnto vs, as if wee had fulfilled the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Law in our fleſh, and for the merits of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:599:350"/> wiping all our ſinnes out of his ſight &amp; remembrance. So that Chriſt his righteouſneſſe alone is our righteouſneſſe before God, which becauſe God doth impute vnto vs freely by his grace through faith, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>it is God that iuſtifieth.</hi> God then iuſtifieth, his grace onely mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, not any of our workes: Chriſt, and his righteouſnes is the righteouſneſſe whereby we are iuſtified, faith is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whereby onely wee are made partakers of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>I know that there are dogges which barke againſt this truth, affirming that the righteouſneſſe whereby we are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is not only imputed vnto vs, but inherent in vs. But this one place may ſerue to deſcrie this their madneſſe. It is of God imputed by him vnto vs, therefore not inherent in vs. It is through faith, therefore not inherent in vs. It is through the faith of Chriſt, therefore really inherent onely in Chriſt. It is not our owne, but onely by faith in Chriſt, therefore not really inherent in vs. If they vrge the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to proue that the righteouſneſſe whereby we are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is inherent in vs, becauſe he ſaith <hi>that a man is iuſtified by workes:</hi> we anſwere that the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh not of that righteouſneſſe whereby man is made righteous before God, but only ſheweth that by a mans workes hee is knowne and declared to be iuſtified by faith; ſo that the Apoſtle maketh not workes in that place the cauſes, but onely the fruites and effects of iuſtification. If they reply that it is a ſufficient proofe that we are iuſtified by workes, becauſe we are iuſtified by faith which is a worke; we anſwer that iuſtification is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to faith, becauſe of Chriſt, and his righteouſneſſe which it receiueth, not becauſe it is a worke of ours. For as it is a worke of ours, ſo it is not without ſome doubting, but is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, as alſo our knowledge, and loue are, and ſo iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not attributed vnto it, but onely as it taketh hold vpon Chriſt Ieſus, and his righteouſneſſe which is our perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.

                  <p>To knit vp the laſt obſeruation in a word, will you know how to be found in Chriſt in that day? A matter worthy your knowledge. For there ſhall be no condemnation vnto them that then ſhall be found in him If then wee will be found in Chriſt in that day we muſt bee found righteous to be iudged by it. And thus farre the matter goeth hard with vs all, being all of vs full of vnrighteouſneſſe and vngodlineſſe. What is then the righteouſnes wherein we muſt be found to be iudged by it in that day?

That hee might know the fellowſhippe of his afflictions, and be made conformable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his death: 5. That he might attaine vnto the reſurrection of the dead. What is the reaſon then why the Apoſtle hauing cauſe of confidence and reioycing in the fleſh, and in things without Chriſt, doth renounce all things without Chriſt, and reioyce only in Chriſt Ieſus? The reaſon is, becauſe reioicing in the fleſh, and in things without Chriſt is vnprofitable, and hurtfull; and contrariwiſe the renouncing of all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, and reioycing onely in Chriſt Ieſus is moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

The knowledge of the fellowſhippe of his afflictions &amp;c. 5. The attaining vnto the reſurrection of the dead.

For ſo he ſaith, that he iudgeth all things loſſe and dung that he may winne Chriſt, and may be found in him &amp;c. as if theſe things could not be vnleſſe he ſhould do ſo. All which vantages doe ſo follow the renouncing of all confidence in the fleſh, and reioycing onely in Chriſt Ieſus, as that theſe foure laſt doe iſſue and ſpring out of the firſt. For being iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, wee know Chriſt, we know the vertue of his reſurrection &amp;c. Theſe being fruits iſſuing and growing out of that righteouſneſſe which is through the faith of Chriſt. Thus much for the generall drift and meaning of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Now for the more particular opening of theſe words, wee muſt know, that by the knowledge of Chriſt is here meant not ſuch a knowledge as wherby we are able to talke of Chriſt, of his birth, of his life, of his doctrine, of his death and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp;c. but ſuch a knowledge as whereby we feele and proue in our ſelues, and in our owne ſoules that hee is indeed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, our reconciliation, our ſaluation, and whatſoeuer elſe we haue heard, or read, or belieued of him in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: not a contemplatiue &amp; knowing knowledge of Chriſt,
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:599:352"/> but a liuely and experimentall knowledge of Chriſt in our owne ſoules. Againe, by the vertue of Chriſt his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtle meaneth that regeneration; i. that dying vnto ſinne, and liuing vnto righteouſneſſe which is wrought in vs by the power of his reſurrection. 3. By the fellowſhippe of Chriſt his afflictions, the Apoſtle meaneth that partaking which Gods Saints haue with Chriſt, of his afflictions for the glorie of Chriſt, and the good of the Church, and their owne conformitie vnto the death of Chriſt. Laſtly, by attaining vnto the reſurrection of the dead, the Apoſtle meaneth that eternall weight of glory in the heauens which onely they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that in this life know Chriſt by experience in their owne ſoules, and by the power of his death and reſurrection die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto righteouſneſſe, and conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch afflictions as the Saints of God are partakers of, that ſo they may be conformable vnto the death of Chriſt, who was conſecrated through afflictions. The ſumme of all is this, the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that he hath no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his merits or workes, but onely reioyceth in Chriſt Ieſus, that ſo he may be iuſtified before God by Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus then yee ſee that both theſe are the fruits of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and that both the righteouſneſſe of faith, and theſe fruits iſſuing out of it are all vantages which the Apoſtle counteth he hath hy renouncing all confidence in the fleſh, and reioycing onely in Chriſt Ieſus. Now let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence for our vſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That I may know him]</hi> This is one end wherefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would bee found in Chriſt hauing his righteouſneſſe through faith, and conſequently wherefore he renounced all his owne merits and works, and onely reioyced in Chriſt
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:599:352"/> Ieſus, euen that he might know Chriſt. For why iudged he his owne righteouſnes to be but loſſe and dunge? That he might winne Chriſt, and be found in him not hauing his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but the righteouſnes of Chriſt through faith. And why would he be found in Chriſt his righteouſneſſe through faith? that he might know Chriſt. This is the fruit of the righteouſnes of faith, and both of them are vantages which follow the renouncing of all confidence in the fleſh, and the reioycing in Chriſt Ieſus. But what? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> know Chriſt? Had he preached Chriſt ſo many yeares, &amp; yet knew not Chriſt? Had he planted ſo many Churches in the faith of Chriſt, and yet knew he not Chriſt? For anſwer herevnto; (to omit that knowledge which is by viſion in heauen, when we ſhall ſee him face to face) we muſt vnderſtand that there are two ſorts of knowledge of Chriſt here on earth: the one, a contemplatiue and knowing knowledge, .i. ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as whereby we know that Chriſt is the onely begotten ſonne of God, that he was ſent into the world to ſaue ſinners, that he was crucified, that he died, that he was buried, that he was declared mightily to be the ſonne of God by his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead, that he was highly exalted, and had a name giuen him aboue euery name &amp;c, and whatſoeuer elſe the ſcriptures of God doe ſtorie of him. Such a knowledge of Chriſt was that which the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had by the ſaying of the woman, which teſtified of him, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.39.</note> 
                     <hi>he hath told me all that euer I did:</hi> and ſuch a knowledge the Phyſitian hath of his phyſicke, and the vertue thereof by relation of others, and by reading in his bookes. The other knowledge of Chriſt is an experimentall and feeling knowledge of Chriſt, whereby we feele &amp; know in our own ſoules that he is ſuch a one as the ſcriptures deſcribe him to be, that he is made of God vnto vs wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption, that he died for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Such a knowledge of Chriſt was that which the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> had when they had heard Chriſt themſelues,<note place="margin">42.</note> and ſo knew that this was indeede the Chriſt, the Sauiour of the world: and ſuch a knowledge of <hi>Salomons</hi> wiſdome and proſperitie the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> had when ſhee had ſeene it with her eies,
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:599:353"/> and heard it with her eares; and ſuch a knowledge the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian hath of his phyſicke, and of the vertue thereof, when he hath had experience of it in himſelfe. Now when the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is here asked, whether <hi>Paul</hi> did not know Chriſt, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>that I may know Chriſt,</hi> we muſt vnderſtand that the Apoſtle doth not here ſpeake of the former ſort of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt: for it is out of all queſtion that he that had preached Chriſt among the Gentiles ſo many yeares, that had planted ſo many Churches in the faith of Chriſt knew what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the ſcriptures of God did witneſſe of Chriſt. But the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of that experimentall and feeling knowledge of Chriſt, whereby we feele and know in our own ſoules that ſuch as the ſcriptures deſcribe him to be ſuch he is vnto vs. What then? Had not the Apoſtle this experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and feeling knowledge of Chriſt? It is not to be doubted but that this holy and elect veſſell of God had this ſame fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus. How then would he be found hauing the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt which is through faith, that he might know Chriſt? It is not ſimply meant that he would be ſo found that he might haue that feeling knowledge of Chriſt, but that he might grow vp daily more and more with all godly increaſing in that feeling knowledge of Chriſt. He would be found righteous with the righteouſneſſe which is of God through faith, that he may daily grow vp with all godly increaſing in this feeling knowledge of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Whence firſt I obſerue what knowledge of Chriſt it is which all Chriſtians ſhould principally long and thirſt after: and that is, that they may know Chriſt with ſuch a feeling knowledge as that they feele and know by experience in their owne ſoules the infinite treaſures of wiſdome, and knowledge, and ſaluation that are hid in him for them: for this is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge of Chriſt to know him not onely to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, but to be our Sauiour. Many there are that know Chriſt to be the ſonne of God, to be the Sauiour of the world, to haue payed the price of mans ſinnes by his one oblation of himſelfe, and to be hee that is appointed iudge both of the quicke and dead in that day. Many there are that can and do ſpeake of his praiſes in the great congregation, that preach
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:599:353"/> vnto others the infinite treaſures of wiſdome, &amp; knowledge, and ſaluation that are hid in him, that talke of his ſaluation from day to day, that ſpeake as if they had all knowledge, and vnderſtanding, and knew Chriſt as well as the beſt. Many I ſay ſuch there are, and I wiſh that the number of them were far greater then it is. But yet here is not all that knowledge of Chriſt that we ſhould long and thirſt after. For thus farre ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come, whoſe knowledge is nothing elſe but the increaſing of their iudgment and condemnation: as the Apoſtle plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſeth where he ſaith,<note place="margin">

We muſt therefore long and thirſt after a farther knowledge of Chriſt. This is the ſauing knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, that we know that wee are the ſonnes of God, that he died for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our iuſtification, that he is made of God vnto vs wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption, that he is the reconciliation for our ſinnes, that he ſitteth at the right hand of God to make requeſt for vs; that an inheritance immortall, and vndefiled, and that fadeth not away is reſerued in heauen for vs. To haue ſuch a feeling knowledge of him, as that by our owne experience in our ſoules we finde in our ſelues the fruits of his ſufferings, the comforts of his promiſes, the riches of his mercies, knowing by the teſtimonie of the ſpirit witneſſing vnto our ſpirit, that what righteouſneſſe hee hath fulfilled for his children he hath fulfilled for vs, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of ſaluation he hath purchaſed for his children he hath purchaſed for vs, what promiſes he hath made vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren belong vnto vs, what ioyes he hath prepared for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are reſerued for vs, this is that knowledge which paſſeth all knowledge, this is that knowledge which is that ſauing knowledge, &amp; this is that knowledge which we muſt long and

                  <p>O my brethren try and examine your hearts how many of you haue this knowledge of Chriſt, and withall ſee and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with your ſelues what a longing and thirſting deſire you ſhould haue after this knowledge of Chriſt. The knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus euen by hearing, and by reading, and by faith is (as not long ſince we heard) the moſt excellent knowledge that is: but this experimentall knowledge of Chriſt, to know by experience in our owne ſoules that he is ſuch as by the word we beleeue him to be, this is the moſt ſweet and moſt comfortable knowledge, euen ſo ſweet and ſo comfortable as paſſeth all vnderſtanding. If yee haue this knowledge of Chriſt, yee are already entred in part into thoſe ioyes which are reſerued in heauen for you. If yee haue it not, ô thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and giue your ſoules no reſt till yee come vnto this knowledge of Chriſt. Giue all diligence vnto the reading and hearing of the word of life, &amp; pray alwaies with all manner of prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit that yee may know Chriſt with a feeling knowledge, and with a ſweet experience in your owne ſoules that whatſoeuer yee haue heard and beleeued of him is moſt true.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I note is, from what roote this experimentall and feeling knowledge of Chriſt iſſueth and ſpringeth, and that is, from the righteouſneſſe of faith. For ſo we are to vnderſtand this knowledge of Chriſt to be a vantage following the renouncing of our owne righteouſnes, and reioycing in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith, as that this vantage ſpringeth from the righteouſneſſe of faith. Hence then I obſerue that onely they know Chriſt by this experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall knowledge, who being iuſtified by faith, doe by a true and
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:599:354"/> liuely faith happly the righteouſneſſe and obedience of Chriſt Ieſus vnto themſelues. For then doe we begin to haue this feeling knowledge of Chriſt in our owne ſoules, when by faith we lay hold on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby; and the more ſure hold that we lay by the hand of faith on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, the more wee grow vp in this feeling knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>We beleeue,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.69.</note> 
                     <hi>and know that thou art the Chriſt the Sonne of the liuing God.</hi> We beleeue, ſaith he, and know, as if he ſhould haue ſaid, we beleeue, and in our owne ſoules by the teſtimonie of the ſpirit witneſſing it to our ſpirit we know that thou art the Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God. Faith then in Chriſt Ieſus is the roote whence this feeling know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt commeth, and the more ſtedfaſtly we beleeue, the greater feeling of this knowledge doth the ſpirit of God worke within our ſoules. Many of vs I feare me want this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling knowledg of Chriſt, many of vs that ſay &amp; thinke that we know him, know him not by experience in our owne ſoules; many of vs that haue heard and read of him, know not that he is made of God vnto vs wiſdome, or righteouſneſſe, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or redemption; many of vs know not what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdome, or knowledge, or ſaluation are laid vp in him for vs; many of vs I feare mee feele not in our ſelues the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, the fruits of his ſufferings, the comforts of his promiſes, the riches of his mercies; many of vs I feare me onely know Chriſt as we heare of Chriſt, and read of Chriſt, but know him not by his comfortable preſence in our owne ſoules. And what is the cauſe of all this? Surely we haue no roote in our ſelues; we want that true and liuely faith whence ſuch knowledge ſhould ſpring. Wee deceiue our ſelues, flattering our ſelues, and ſaying, we beleeue in Chriſt, we know Chriſt, when as we neither beleeue in him, nor know him. A ſmattering faith, and a ſmattering knowledge of Chriſt we haue: but a iuſtifying faith, or ſauing knowledge we haue none. Is then a iuſtifying faith the roote whence a feeling and ſauing knowledg doth ſpring?</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs to vſe with all religious reuerence thoſe meanes which the Lord hath ordained for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:599:355"/> and increaſing of faith in vs, that we may beleeue, and know, and growing in faith we may grow alſo in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Ieſus.

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ro.</hi> 10.17.</note> Seeing therefore wee cannot know Chriſt vnleſſe we beleeue in him, and ſeeing we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him vnleſſe we heare his word preached, that we may beleeue in him, and know him, let vs willingly flocke as doues vnto the windowes vnto the houſe of the Lord to heare the word preached. Againe, as by the word preached, ſo likewiſe by the vſe of the Sacraments the Lord as by meanes ſtrengthneth and increaſeth our faith in vs. In the Lords Supper the bread is broken for vs, giuen to vs, we take it, and eat it, and digeſt it, and it is made one ſubſtance with vs: the wine likewiſe is powred out for vs, giuen vnto vs, we take it, and drinke it, and it is made one with vs. All which rites and actions what elſe are they but ſo many pledges and ſeales for the ſtrengthning and increaſing of our faith in the benefits of our ſaluation pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chaſed by the death and paſſion of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus. The bread that is broken for vs in that Supper, and the wine that is powred out for vs, they are ſo ſure pledges vnto vs that Chriſt his bodie was broken for vs, and his bloud ſhed for vs as that we ought as ſtedfaſtly to beleeue the one by faith, as we clearely ſee the other with our eyes. So likewiſe the bread and the wine that are giuen vnto vs by the Miniſter in the Supper, they are ſo ſure pledges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that Chriſt by his Spirit giueth vs his bodie, and his bloud euen then in the ſupper, as that we ought as ſtedfaſtly to beleeue the one by faith, as we clearely ſee the other with our eyes. So likewiſe the bread which with the hand of our bodie we take, and eat, and the wine which with the hand of our bodie we take and drinke are ſo ſure pledges vnto vs that by faith our ſoules doe feede vpon the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, as that we ought as ſtedfaſtly to beleeue the one by faith, as we clearely ſee the other with our eyes. Laſtly, the
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:599:355"/> bread and wine which being digeſted are turned into our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and made one with vs, and we with them are ſo ſure ſeales vnto vs that by a myſticall vnion and ſpirituall coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we are made one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with vs, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie, fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones, as that we ought as ſtedfaſtly to beleeue this by faith, as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know that by ſenſe. Such are the helps which we haue by this holy ſacrament of the Lords Supper for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and increaſing of our faith. Many things yee ſee here are fully to aſſure our faith that we ſhould not doubt, but as ſurely as we receiue the bread and wine into our bodies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholly ours, ſo withall our ſoule receiueth Chriſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his paſſion and righteouſneſſe to be wholly ours, as ſurely as if we had wrought them in our owne perſons. Yea ſuch aſſurance our faith groweth vnto by the vſe of this holy Supper, as that now we know by the powerfull operation of Gods holy ſpirit within vs that God is in vs indeed, and that now Chriſt is ours, and we Chriſts, and that together with Chriſt we haue all things, euen all the benefits of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the more that our faith is ſtrengthned hereby, the more alſo is this feeling knowledge of Chriſt increaſed in vs, ſo that together with the growth of our faith there is a growth of this knowledge. Seeing therefore this knowledge of Chriſt groweth as our faith in Chriſt groweth, and ſeeing our faith is ſo ſtrengthned and increaſed by the holy vſe of this holy Supper, let vs ſo often as we are called vnto this holy table prepare our ſelues with all holy reuerence and feare to the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of theſe holy myſteries. Great is the benefit that here we doe receiue if we eat of this bread, and drinke of this cup worthily: for then we eat ſpiritually the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his bloud; then we dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in vs, we are one with Chriſt and Chriſt with vs, and theſe things are ſo ſenſibly repreſented vnto our eyes and taſte, as that our faith is fully aſſured thereof; ſo that henceforth we know by the working of the ſpirit that Chriſt is ours, together with whatſoeuer is his. But if we preſent our ſelues at theſe holy myſteries without due preparation and examination of our ſelues, we haue no ſuch benefit, but rather we are guilty of the
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:599:356"/> bodie and bloud of our Lord and Sauiour. Proue therefore your ſelues whether you are in the faith, whether yee feele your hearts aſſured by the ſpirit of God that the puniſhment of your ſinnes is fully diſcharged in Chriſt, and that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Chriſt hath done pertaineth not onely to others, but euen to you alſo. If you beleeue theſe things, and know theſe things, though it be not without ſome doubts, and without ſome imperfections, behold by the vſe of this Supper your weake faith, and imperfect knowledge ſhall be ſtrengthned and increaſed. But if as yet yee haue no ſuch faith in Chriſt, no ſuch knowledge of Chriſt, then may yee not preſume to preſent your ſelues at this holy table. The vſe of this Supper is for the confirmation and ſtrengthning of our faith, it is not for the begetting of faith in vs, but that being begotten by the word, is by the word and the vſe of the Sacrament thus confirmed.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing which hence I obſerue is, that if we will haue this experimentall knowledge of Chriſt in our owne ſoules by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, then muſt wee renounce all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our owne merits and in our owne righteouſneſſe whatſoeuer. For wherefore is it that men truſt in their owne merits, and in their owne righteouſneſſe? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that men make reckoning to be iuſtified and ſaued by the worth of their owne workes? Wherefore is it that men grow to a phariſaicall pride and conceit of themſelues, as if they had ſomewhat in themſelues that might abide the tryall? Surely it is becauſe of the want of this feeling know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt: They neuer felt in their owne ſoules the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, the comforts of Chriſt, the treaſures of Chriſt. They know not by experience in their owne ſoules that Chriſt is all in all vnto them: they know not what Chriſt is made of God vnto his children. They haue a knowledge of Chriſt, but the knowledge of Chriſt hath not ſeazed vpon their ſoules; and therefore they doe not know the full ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, and the full worth of Chriſt. For if they knew in their owne ſoules that Chriſt were made of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption, they would onely reioyce in Chriſt Ieſus, and
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:599:356"/> haue no confidence in the fleſh. But therefore they reioyce in the fleſh, and haue confidence in their owne workes, and in their owne righteouſneſſe, becauſe they know not Chriſt. If therefore we will know Chriſt with a ſauing knowledge, and a feeling knowledge of him in our ſelues, we muſt vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all confidence in our owne merits, and all truſt in our owne righteouſneſſe whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then vnto them that ſtand vpon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and worth of their owne workes, and of their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes? Surely euen thereby they ſhew that howſoeuer they ſay they know Chriſt, yet they haue not this experimentall knowledge of him in their owne ſoules: for if they had, they would know ſuch infinite treaſures of all ſpirituall graces to be hid in him as that they would minde nothing without him. To conclude this point therefore, let theſe truſt in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, let thoſe follow their vaine delights and pleaſures, let theſe ſeeke after riches, let thoſe ſpend their whole time in the ſtudie of humane knowledge: but let vs ſtudie to know Chriſt. If we haue this feeling knowledge of him in our owne ſoules, then come pouertie, come ſicknes, come famine, come ſword, come perſecution, come affliction, come aduerſitie, come what croſſe can come, our ſoule notwithſtanding all theſe is at quiet reſt, and in him we haue comfort enough againſt all theſe. In him becauſe we know him, we know that treaſures enow; and comforts enow are hid for vs whatſoeuer trouble or aduerſitie we finde in the world. Let vs therefore ſtudie to know him, and becauſe faith is the roote of this knowledge, let vs vſe with all religious reuerence thoſe meanes whereby faith is either wrought, or confirmed. And becauſe confidence in our owne merits and righteouſnes is an enemie to this knowledge, let vs renounce all ſuch confidence, and reioyce onely in Chriſt Ieſus that we may know him &amp;c.</p>

For by reſurrection in this place I vnderſtand both Chriſt his death and reſurrection: and by the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not that power whereby Chriſt ouercame death, and roſe againe from the dead, but that regeneration, that dying vnto ſinne, and liuing vnto righteouſneſſe which the Holy Ghoſt worketh in vs by the power of Chriſt his death, and reſurrection. The third vantage then which the Apoſtle reckons vpon by diſclaiming al righteouſnes by his own works, and reioycing onely in Chriſt Ieſus is, that hereby he ſhall know the vertue of Chriſt his reſurrection in himſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall daily more and more die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto righteouſneſſe, which vertue of his reſurrection he greatly deſired to know, and which otherwiſe he could not know.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And that I may know the vertue.]</hi> Here firſt I note the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles great deſire to know and to feele in himſelfe by the worke of the holy Ghoſt the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He reckoned this knowledge amongſt the chiefe van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which he had in Chriſt Ieſus, and for this vantage ſake he made no reckoning at all of his owne righteouſneſſe by any workes that hee had wrought. Such a longing and thirſting deſire hee had to know the vertue of Chriſt his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. He knew Chriſt his death and reſurrection, that he died, and was buried, and that hee roſe againe the third day; but hee deſired to know the vertue of his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. He knew likewiſe this vertue of Chriſt his death, that thereby he had vanquiſhed ſinne, death, and the deuill, and this vertue of his reſurrection, that thereby hee had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for him righteouſneſſe, life, and euerlaſting ſaluation: but he deſired to know and to feele in himſelfe the death of ſinne by the vertue of his death, and the life of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe by the vertue of his reſurrection. This vertue alſo of Chriſt his death and reſurrection he knew, in that hee felt in himſelfe by the power of the ſpirit a dying vnto ſinne, and a liuing vnto righteouſneſſe: but hee deſired to feele this vertue of his death and reſurrection in himſelfe daily more and more, that hee might daily more and more die in the old man, and be quickened in the new man, that in euery combat betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, the fleſh might daily more and more be ſubdued to the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Whence I obſerue, what a vehement and earneſt deſire there ſhould be in vs all to know and to feele in our ſelues the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, and in whom there is ſome feeling thereof, to know and to feele it in themſelues daily more and more. Wee all of vs know that Chriſt died for our ſinnes, and that he roſe againe for the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our iuſtification: wee know that by the power of his death wee are deliuered from the firſt and from the ſecond death, from the death of ſinne in this life, and from the death of damnation for ſinne after this life, and that by the power of his reſurrection wee haue our part both in the firſt and in
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:599:358"/> the ſecond reſurrection, in the firſt reſurrection from ſinne vnto righteouſneſſe, and in the ſecond reſurrection from the power of the graue vnto life euerlaſting. Wee know that wee are buried with Chriſt by baptiſme into his death, that like as he was raiſed vp from the dead by the glory of the Father, ſo wee alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life. We know that if we be grafted with Chriſt to the ſimilitude of his death, dying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne by the power of his death, euen ſo wee ſhall be to the ſimilitude of his reſurrection, liuing vnto God by the power of his reſurrection. Theſe things (I ſay) wee know, at leaſt we ſhould know, and I wiſh that they were farre better and more knowne then they are. But there is a further knowledge of the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, which in our ſoules wee muſt long and thirſt after. This is the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection that we muſt long and thirſt after, to know and to feele in our ſelues the death of ſinne, and the life of God, to know and to feele in our ſelues that the ſtrength of ſinne is abated in our fleſh, and that the life of God is renewed in the ſpirit of our minde, to know and to feele in our ſelues a loathing of ſinne, and a loue of righteouſneſſe, to know and to feele in our ſelues a mortification of the fleſh with the affections and the luſts, and a quickening in our ſpirit by the fruits of the ſpirit, to know and to feele in our ſelues that delight which ſometimes wee tooke in vnrighteouſneſſe, in vncleanneſſe, in couetouſneſſe, in pride, in crueltie, in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the like ſinnes, to be cooled, and a deſire to liue righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and ſoberly, and godly in this preſent world, to bee kindled in vs. For hereby we know in our ſelues the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, if we feele in our ſelues this mortification of the old man, and this quickening in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man: when his death workes the death of ſinne in vs, when his reſurrection workes the life of God in vs, then wee know in our ſelues the vertue of his death and reſurrection. The ſacrament hereof is the ſacrament of baptiſme: for when wee are baptized, wee are baptized into the ſimilitude of his death, that like as he died once for ſinne, ſo we ſhould euer die vnto ſinne, and into the ſimilitude of his reſurrection, that like as he roſe from the dead, ſo wee which were dead in ſinne
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:599:358"/> ſhould not henceforth ſerue ſinne, but liue vnto God in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and true holineſſe. Euen our baptiſme doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto vs, that ſo many of vs as are baptized into Chriſt Ieſus, wee ſhould die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and true holineſſe. Which death vnto ſinne, and life vnto God, ſeeing the holy ſpirit of God doth worke in vs by the power of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, how ſhould we not moſt earneſtly deſire to know and to feele in our ſelues the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection?</p>
                  <p>But doe wee deſire to know and to feele in our ſelues the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection? Doe we with our Apoſtle in this place reckon this knowledge amongſt our chiefeſt vantages? Nay alas we know it not, neither care we to know it: for what dying vnto ſinne and liuing vnto God is there amongſt vs? In whom is the ſtrength of ſinne abated, and the life of God renewed in the ſpirit of his minde? Doth the Atheiſt leaue his Atheiſme, and embrace godlineſſe? Doth the couetous perſon leaue off to ſet his affection on the things which are on the earth, and ſet his affection on the things which are aboue? Doth the cruell oppreſſor leaue off to grinde the faces of the poore, and beginne to be mercifull? Doth the vſurer leaue off to lend his money vpon vſurie, and beginne to lend freely? Doth the ſwearer leaue off to ſweare, and beginne to feare an oath? Doth the filthy whore-monger and adulterer leaue off his vncleanneſſe, and beginne to liue chaſtly? Doth the contentious perſon leaue off to brawle and contend with his neighbour, and beginne to loue quietneſſe? Doth the drunkard leaue his drunkenneſſe, and beginne to liue ſoberly? &amp;c. Doth any prophane and wicked perſon leaue off his prophaneneſſe and wickedneſſe, and beginne to liue righteouſly and godly in this preſent world? Nay ſo farre are wee from dying vnto ſinne, and liuing vnto God, that contrariwiſe wee liue vnto ſinne in ſinne, and wee are dead in reſpect of the life of God. If wee would denie it, yet doe the iudgements of God teſtifie it vnto our faces. Hath not the ſword beene ſhaken againſt vs by the hand of a cruell and mercileſſe enemie now a long time? Hath there not beene cleanneſſe of teeth in all our cities, ſcarceneſſe of bread in all
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:599:359"/> our places, euen a great dearth and famine throughout this whole land now a long time? Hath not grieuous ſickneſſe and mortalitie, great plagues and ſtrange diſeaſes taken away ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of our people? And is not the hand of the Lord ſtill ſtretched out againſt vs? Doe not dearth and famine on one hand, and ſickneſſe and mortalitie on another hand, ſtill deuoure our people? And are not theſe the meſſengers of Gods fierce wrath againſt vs for our ſinnes? Yes certainly euen for our ſinnes and iniquities are all theſe things come vpon vs. And becauſe he hath ſmitten vs, and wee are not healed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath laid his puniſhing hand vpon vs, and wee haue not turned from the wickedneſſe of our wayes vnto him, therefore his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſtill. No man knoweth the vertue of Chriſt his death, or careth to know it, but euery man walketh after the wayes of his owne heart, and drinketh iniquitie like water. No man knoweth the vertue of Chriſt his reſurrection, or careth to know it, but euery man in ſtead of riſing vp vnto holineſſe of life, riſeth vp to eat, drinke, and play, and therefore doth the hand of God lie ſtill ſo heauie vpon vs. O my brethren, at length let vs follow the counſell of the Apoſtle, let vs morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Let vs crucifie the fleſh with the affections and the luſts, and walke in the ſpirit: Let vs put off the old man which is corrupt through the deceiueable luſts, and let vs put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holines. For this let vs all know, that whoſoeuer in this life dieth not this death which is vnto ſinne, no man ſhall deliuer his ſoule from the hand of the ſecond death after this life: and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hath not his part in the firſt reſurrection, which is from ſinne vnto righteouſneſſe, he ſhall haue no part in the ſecond reſurrection, which is vnto glory and life euerlaſting. And ſuch as doe know and feele in themſelues the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, them I exhort in the bowels of Chriſt Ieſus, that with the Apoſtle they deſire and labour to know and to feele this vertue in themſelues daily more and
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:599:359"/> more. Stand faſt againſt all the aſſaults of the deuill, and quit your ſelues like men: embrace holineſſe, and follow after righteouſneſſe. While yee liue, the fleſh will rebell againſt the ſpirit, but ſtriue daily more and more to ſubdue the fleſh vnto the ſpirit. Conſider with your ſelues with all godly care what ſinne it is that moſt doth haunt you, couetouſneſſe, or licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or pride, or hatred, or ſwearing, or lying, or the like, and fight againſt that, labour daily more and more againſt that, ſeeke daily more and more to cruſh that in the head. Againe, conſider with your ſelues what good thing yee are too dull and ſlacke vnto, hearing of the word, or liberalitie to the poore, or patience in aduerſitie, or the like, and labour daily more and more vnto that, follow daily more and more after that, ſeeke daily more and more after that. In a word, ſtirre vp euery good grace of God in you, and refraine your feet from euery euill path, that ye may know and feele in your ſelues the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, and doe this daily more and more, that ye may feele in your ſelues this vertue daily more and more.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I note, is, from what root this knowledge of the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction iſſueth and ſpringeth, and that is, from the righteouſnes of faith: for ſtill wee muſt remember that theſe foure laſt van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, doe ſo follow the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of all our owne workes, and the reioicing only in Chriſt Ieſus, as that they all iſſue from the firſt vantage that we haue thereby, namely from the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt through faith. Whence I obſerue, that only they that are iuſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt through faith, doe feele in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by the powerfull operation of the holy Ghoſt the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, whereby they die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto God in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe. And to this the Apoſtle ſeemeth to giue witneſſe, where hee ſaith, that our hearts are purified by faith:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9.</note> for it is as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, wee are purified and purged from dead workes to ſerue the liuing God: but how is it? It is by faith in Chriſt Ieſus. So that the Apoſtles meaning is, that only they that are iuſtified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, are purged from dead
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:599:360"/> workes to ſerue the liuing God. For if this purification bee by faith, then only they that haue faith are thus purged. So our Sauiour alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.4.</note> 
                     <hi>As the branch cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it abide in the vine, no more can yee except yee abide in mee.</hi> Whence it is moſt plaine, that they onely that are ingrafted into Chriſt Ieſus by a true and liuely faith in him, whereby they take hold of his righteouſneſſe, bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit, dying vnto ſinne, and liuing vnto God in newneſſe and holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Why is it then that there is ſo little knowledge amongſt vs of the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection? The reaſon is, only the faithfull children of God know it. The reſt they haue no root in themſelues, they want that true and liuely faith whence ſuch knowledge ſhould ſpring. Let this then ſerue to rowſe vs out of the dead ſleepe of ſinne, and to awake vs vnto righteouſneſſe. That the death and reſurrection of Chriſt worke no better vpon vs, that wee ſubdue not the fleſh vnto the ſpirit, that we ſerue ſinne, and giue not our members ſeruants vnto righteouſneſſe in holineſſe, it is a plaine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the want of faith in vs. And therefore our Sauiour made it an argument againſt <hi>Iudas</hi> that hee beleeued not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would betray him.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.64.</note> 
                     <hi>But there are ſome of you,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>that beleeue not: For</hi> (ſaith the Euangeliſt) <hi>Ieſus knew from the beginning who they were that beleeued not, and who ſhould betray him.</hi> Where the argument is that <hi>Iudas</hi> had a traiterous heart, therefore he beleeued not. In like manner let vs make the argument againſt our ſelues: Our hearts are ſett on miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, we drinke iniquitie like water, wee die not vnto ſinne, but wee ſuffer ſinne to raigne in our mortall bodies, wee liue not vnto God in righteouſneſſe, but wee giue our members ſeruants vnto vnrighteouſneſſe; wee feele no vertue at all of Chriſt his death or reſurrection in our ſelues, therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not. The concluſion is hard; but if it bee altered, the premiſſes muſt be altered. Let vs ceaſe to doe euill, and learne to doe well; let vs die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto God; let vs mortifie our earthly members, and be filled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe, and then ſhall wee haue a good teſtimonie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues of our righteouſneſſe by faith. In a word, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:599:360"/> which is by faith, and regeneration which is by the ſpirit killing our old man, and quickening our new man are ſo linked the one with the other, as that they are affirmed, and denied both together. For if we be iuſtified by faith, then are we regenerate by the ſpirit, and if wee be regenerate by the ſpirit, then are we iuſtified by faith: And againe, vnleſſe wee be iuſtified by faith wee are not regenerate by the ſpirit, and vnleſſe we be regenerated by the ſpirit, we are not iuſtified by faith. As therefore we deſire to haue our iuſtification by faith ſealed vnto our ſoules, ſo let vs deſire to know and to feele in our ſelues the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, by dying vnto ſinne, and liuing vnto God in righteouſneſſe and true holines. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the fellowſhippe of his afflictions &amp;c.]</hi> This is the next vantage which the Apoſtle reckons vpon by renouncing all his owne workes as loſſe and dung, and reioycing onely in Chriſt Ieſus, the knowledge in himſelfe of Chriſt his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, euen ſuch as he did ſuffer in the daies of his fleſh, and ſuch as he doth daily ſuffer in his members. And the reaſon he addeth why he would know in himſelfe the fellowſhip of Chriſt his afflictions, namely ſo to be made conformable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt his death. It is then as if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid, I make no reckoning of mine owne righteouſneſſe by workes, but my deſire is, that being iuſtified by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt through faith, in ſuch afflictions as Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his owne perſon for the glory of God and the good of his Church, and ſuch as ſtill hee ſuffereth in his members for his owne glory, &amp; the good of his Church. I may haue fellowſhip and bee partakers with them, becauſe I deſire to be made comformable vnto Chriſt his death, i. like vnto Chriſt who is dead, and through many afflictions is entred into his kingdome. What then? did the Apoſtle deſire out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions in his body? yea hee counted it a great van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſuffer afflictions ſuch as Chriſt had ſuffred in his own perſon, and ſuch as hee did ſuffer in his members, for the glory of Chriſt, and the good of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Hence then I obſerue that affliction and trouble for Chriſt his ſake, and the good of his Church ſhould not ſeeme grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous

His wife which ſhould haue beene his helper, bid him blaſpheame God and die. His friends which ſhould haue comforted him encreaſed his ſorowes; ſo that euery way he was moſt grieuouſly afflicted. Compare now then thine afflictions and ſorowes with his, and ſee what compariſon there is betwixt them for greatneſſe and grieuouſneſſe. And if the Lord bleſſed his laſt daies more then the firſt in goods, and in children, and in euery good bleſſing; then let not thy great affliction trouble thee, but hope thou in the Lord, and abide patiently on him, and he ſhall make thy way to proſper.

Of whom we read, firſt that he fled to <hi>Laban</hi> leaſt his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould kill him; when he was with <hi>Laban</hi> hee dealt ill with him, and changed his wages tenne times; when he went from <hi>Laban, Laban</hi> purſued him, and if the Lord had not forbid him would ſurely haue hurt him; when hee had eſcaped <hi>Laban,</hi> then he was againe in great danger by his brother <hi>Eſau;</hi> when hee had eſcaped that danger, then his daughter <hi>Dinah</hi> was rauiſhed, and his ſonnes <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leuie</hi> ſlew the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> and brought him into great danger there; when he went from thence, his wife <hi>Rahel</hi> in the way died in trauell; ſoone after <hi>Reuben</hi> his eldeſt ſonne went vp vnto his fathers bed, and lay with <hi>Bilhah</hi> his fathers concubine.

<pb n="704" facs="tcp:599:363"/> Chriſt himſelfe did? He was full of ſorowes all his life long. Thou maiſt not preſcribe God a time, thou muſt in patience poſſeſſe thy ſoule. Heauineſſe may endure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning. And what if it come not the next morning? what if it come not the next week? the next month; the next yeare? nay what if thy daies bee conſumed with mourning? O in the morning when his glory ſhall appeare thou ſhalt be glad and reioyce. For the preſent thy faith and thy patience is exerciſed, and for the preſent it is grieuous, but afterwards it bringeth the quiet fruite of righteouſneſſe vnto thee that art exerciſed thereby. Oh, but thou wilt ſay, what comfort can I haue in the meane time ſeeing he afflicteth mee as the wicked, and maketh no difference betweene me and the wicked? Oh, but thou art much deceiued. He afflicteth thee, and he afflicteth the wicked, and it may be with like afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but yet not in like ſort. Hee afflicteth thee as a father, him as a iudge, thee in mercy and in loue, him in anger and diſpleaſure, thee for thy correction and chaſtiſement, him for a plague and puniſhment. He chaſtiſeth thee with roddes, but he woundeth him with the ſwords of an enemie: thou by thy corrections art kept in a child-like awe, hee in a ſlauiſh feare; the effect of thine afflictions is, reformation of things paſt, and obedience afterwards to thy good; but the effect of his is hardnes of heart, and rebellion againſt the higheſt; the end of thine is ioy euerlaſting, the end of his is woe euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Though therefore your afflictions ſeeme to be like, yet is the whole courſe of them altogether vnlike, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the manner, in the vſe, in the effect, and in the end. What then though thine afflictions be great? It is a token that he hath giuen thee great grace and ſtrength to ſtand. For he <hi>will not ſuffer his to be tempted aboue that they be able,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</note>

It is that, as gold purified ſeuen times in the fire, thou maiſt bee found more precious at the appearing of Ieſus Chriſt; what though thou haſt waited long? It is that thy patience may haue her perfect worke, and that thou maiſt be perfit, and entire, lacking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. What though there be no oddes vnto thine outward
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:599:363"/> ſenſe between thy ſufferings and the wicked? It is that thou maiſt grow out of loue with that reſtleſſe and wretched life, and maiſt long after that life where there ſhall be no more death, nor ſorow, nor crying, nor paine, but life without death, ioy without ſorow, reſt without crying, and pleaſure without paine.</p>
                  <p>If this will not ſerue to make thee brooke thine afflictions be they great, or many, or whatſoeuer they be, then conſider theſe points Chriſtianly and with a wiſe heart. 1. Conſider what thou haſt deſerued if the Lord ſhould deale with thee in weight and meaſure. Are thine afflictions and thy troubles proportioned to the deſert of thy ſinnes? Nay if hee ſhould diſpute with thee thou couldeſt not anſwere him one thing of a thouſand: if he would ſtraightly marke thine iniquities, thou were not able to ſtand when he is angrie. No ſinne that thou committeſt in the whole courſe of thy life, but the wages of it is death, euen euerlaſting death both of body and ſoule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lords ſpeciall mercy. What are then thine afflictions vnto that that thou haſt deſerued? 2. Conſider how light and momentanie thine afflictions are. For what if they be for a yeare? what if for twentie? what if for thy whole life? when the Lord had puniſhed his people with 70. yeares captiuitie, <hi>for a moment,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſ.</hi> 54.8.</note>

Euen ſo the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that thou ſuffereſt, if they be for ſeuenty, if for a 100. yeares, what is this in compariſon of eternity? Who would make account of taking very bitter potions, and very ſharpe phiſicke for three or foure daies together, in hope of health for euer after? What then if thy potions, if thy phiſicke, if thine afflictions be for 70. or 100. yeares? It is not ſo much as three or foure daies, nor ſo much as three or foure houres, nay nothing in compariſon of eternitie. And therefore the Apoſtle very well calleth the afflictions of this life light and momentanie afflictions in reſpect of that eternall weight of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Is it pouertie, perſecution, hunger; agonie in ſoule, puniſhment in body? Are we reuiled, ſlandered, mocked, tempted by the Deuill? Doth the wicked band themſelues againſt vs, vniuſtly accuſe vs, vniuſtly condemne vs, vniuſtly put vs to death? Are they of thine houſhold thine enemies? doe they that eate bread at table with thee lift vp their heeles againſt thee, and betray thee into the hands of the wicked and vngodly? All this way our Sauiour Chriſt hath walked before vs: he hath drunke of all theſe cuppes, and hath ſeaſoned them vnto vs. Neither did he onely ſuffer theſe and the like afflictions before vs, but as the head with the members ſtill hee ſuffereth theſe and the like afflictions with vs. How many, how great, how aboue meaſure were <hi>Pauls</hi> troubles by ſea, by land, of friends, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, in body, in ſpirit? yet calleth he them all the afflictions of Chriſt, becauſe in them all Chriſt ſuffered with him. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> likewiſe in all his pouertie, ſickneſſe, ſores, griefes, and miſeries ſuffered nothing wherein Chriſt was not partaker of his griefe.

                  <p>My 2. obſeruation was, that afflictions doe make vs like vnto Chriſt. He was conſecrated the Prince of our ſaluation through afflictions.

If God haue giuen vnto vs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, cold, nakedneſſe, and much affliction, if we feele many troubles to reſt vpon vs, if we feele that greateſt trouble of an affrighted ſoule, and a minde oppreſſed, let vs thinke with our ſelues; how good is God vnto vs, thus to make the image of his onely begotten ſonne to ſhine in vs, that wee carying his image in vs may die with him, and alſo reigne with him in the due time which he hath appointed.

For we are to wiſh, and we are to iudge all things without Chriſt to be but dung, that we may attaine vnto the reſurrection of the dead. If therefore by the meanes of affliction, or by any meanes we

When therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith here, <hi>if by any meanes,</hi> this <hi>(if)</hi> implieth not any doubting in the Apoſtle, but an earneſt deſire in the Apoſtle to attaine to the reſurrection of the dead.

Now the Apoſtle ſignifieth, that it is al one to him, if by any meanes, the firſt, ſecond, or third, he may attaine to the reſurrection of the dead. Laſtly, by the reſurrection of the dead, the Apoſtle meaneth the glorious reſurrection of the Saints vn to life euerlaſting. It is then as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, I doe iudge all things without Chriſt to be but dung, that I may winne Chriſt, that I may know Chriſt, and the vertue of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his afflictions, and that I may attaine to the glorious reſurrection of the Saints, if by any meanes, or deſiring by any meanes, affliction, or any meanes to attaine and come vnto the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſurrection of the Saints, whereby they are raiſed vnto glory, and life, and immortalitie.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus wee haue heard how the Apoſtle for the confutation of thoſe falſe Teachers that were crept in among the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> hath inſtructed them by his owne example in the point touching mans righteouſneſſe before God, namely that they were not to repoſe any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their owne righteouſneſſe which is by workes, but to repoſe all their confidence in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is through faith: for he iudged all his owne workes to be but loſſe and dung in reſpect of any righteouſneſſe before God, and he reioyced only in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that he might winne Chriſt, that hee might know Chriſt, and the vertue of his reſurrection, &amp;c. and therefore the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> were to doe ſo too, and wee ſo too.</p>
                  <p>Now the Apoſtle goeth forward, and as before by his owne example he taught them what to thinke of mans righteouſnes before God, ſo now by his owne example hee teacheth them ſtill to labour to increaſe in the way of godlineſſe, and in the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, and of the vertue of his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. And he taketh occaſion ſo to doe vpon that which he had ſaid before: for he had ſaid before, that hee thought all things loſſe for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt Ieſus,
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:599:368"/> and that hee iudged all things to be dung that he might winne Chriſt, that he might know Chriſt, &amp;c. Now hereupon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily it might be thought that hee was growne to an excellent knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, hee was perfect in the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus. Did he take ſuch pleaſure and comfort in the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, that for it hee thought all things loſſe and dung? Here was perfection indeed, hee was come to the races end, he needed no more. No, no, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; for all this I am but in the way, I haue not yet attained to the perfect knowledge of Chriſt, I am not perfect in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, I follow and labour after it with all maine and might that I haue, I am entred the liſts, I am in the way, and I neuer looke behinde mee, but ſtill I goe forward; and albeit I be not at my races end, yet ſtill I am looking toward the marke that is ſet before mee, and I make towards the marke as hard as euer I can. Thus the Apoſtle by his owne example ſets an edge on them to runne forward in the race that they had begunne in Chriſt Ieſus, and to labour ſtill to increaſe in the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus. Which hee did the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe falſe Teachers that were amongſt them, that told them that they knew Chriſt well enough, and that they were come to great perfection in the knowledge of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in that they know him to be the Meſſias, to bee God and man, to be the reconciliation for the ſins of the whole world: and now they were to looke to the obſeruation and keeping of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and to ioyne it vnto Chriſt, ſo to be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God. Becauſe of theſe (I ſay) the Apoſtle hauing taught them that not any thing is to be ioyned vnto Chriſt to be made righteous by it, doth now ſtirre them vp by his owne example to labour continually to increaſe in the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus. Thus much for the generall ſcope and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs yet a little more particularly examine theſe words. <hi>Not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as though I had already attained to it:</hi> to it, to what? to the perfect knowledge of Chriſt: for the Apoſtle had ſaid before, that <hi>hee thought all things loſſe for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>he iudged them to be dung that he might win Chriſt, that he might know Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="715" facs="tcp:599:368"/> and hereupon it might be thought that hee had already attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the perfect knowledge of Chriſt, and of the vertue of his reſurrection, &amp;c. whereby he might attaine to the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead. But no, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I iudge all things to be dung, that I may know Chriſt; not as though I had already attained to the perfect knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> Againe, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that he ſaith, <hi>not as though I had already,</hi> or, <hi>not as though I had now attained to it:</hi> whereby the Apoſtle ſignifieth, that as now his ſtate ſtands, he hath not attained to the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt. He addeth, <hi>either were now perfect,</hi> to wit, in the knowledge of Chriſt, and ſo of the vertue of his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. Hee addeth, <hi>but I follow,</hi>

By this then hee ſignifieth how greedily and inceſſantly he purſueth after the perfect knowledge of Chriſt, hauing it as it were in chaſe. <hi>I follow,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if I may comprehend that,</hi> that is, deſiring to catch hold of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>euen as I alſo am comprehended of Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> that is, euen as Chriſt Ieſus hath caught hold on mee: that is, deſiring that as Chriſt hath perfectly caught hold of mee by his gracious mercy towards mee, ſo I may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is then as if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid, I thanke my God I know Chriſt, and the vertue of his reſurrection, &amp;c. and I take great comfort and pleaſure in the knowledge of Chriſt, and I thinke all things but loſſe for this excellent knowledge ſake; not as though I had now attained vnto this knowledge perfectly, or were now as I am now <hi>Paul,</hi> aged, and taught by God in the wayes of God, perfect in the knowledge of Chriſt; nay I now know him only in part, but I follow this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge euen with eagre and inceſſant purſuit, deſiring that I may comprehend and catch hold of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, euen as perfectly, and in the like mercy that hee hath

                  <p>In theſe words then I note theſe points: firſt, the Apoſtles acknowledgement of his owne imperfection, in theſe words, <hi>not as though, &amp;c.</hi> ſecondly, the Apoſtles eagre purſuit after perfection, in theſe words, <hi>but I follow, &amp;c.</hi> Now let vs ſee what obſeruations wee may gather hence for our vſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not as though, &amp;c.]</hi> Here you ſee that the Apoſtle acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that as yet hee had not attained to the full knowledge of Chriſt, to a thorow-feeling of the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection in himſelfe, to a perfect fellowſhip of Chriſt his afflictions. He laboured to attaine to the reſurrection of the dead in glory, by communicating with Chriſt in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, by dying vnto ſinne, and liuing vnto God through the power of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, by knowing Chriſt with a feeling knowledge of him in his owne ſoule. But hee ſaith that he hath not yet perfectly attained vnto theſe thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> whereby he might attaine vnto the reſurrection of the dead. And he amplifieth it by this particle <hi>Now,</hi> ſaying that now be had not attained vnto theſe things, now that hee had ſhaken off all impediments and hinderances vnto perfection in theſe things, now that he had renounced all confidence in his owne workes, and in all things without Chriſt, now that he laboured to attaine to the knowledge of Chriſt in his owne ſoule, to the knowledge of the vertue of Chriſt his reſurrection, to the knowledge of the fellowſhip of Chriſt his afflictions in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if by any meanes he might attaine to the reſurrection of the dead, yet not as yet he had attained to the full knowledge of Chriſt in himſelfe, to a thorow-feeling of the vertue of Chriſt his reſurrection in himſelfe, to a perfect fellowſhip of Chriſt his afflictions.</p>
                  <p>My obſeruation hence is, that all the faithfull children of God, how plentifully ſoeuer endowed with the knowledge of Chriſt, the hatred of ſinne, the loue of righteouſneſſe the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of Chriſt his afflictions, yet only know Chriſt in this
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:599:369"/> life in part, onely die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto God, and are partakers of Chriſt his afflictions in part, not one that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knoweth Chriſt, that perfectly feeleth the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection in himſelfe, that is perfectly partaker of Chriſt his afflictions. For is it not a good reaſon? <hi>Paul</hi> that holy Apoſtle of Chriſt Ieſus, that choſen veſſell of God to beare Chriſt his name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> aged <hi>Paul,</hi> that had begotten many in the faith and knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, that had now long borne in his body the dying of Chriſt Ieſus, that had his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation in heauen, that had ſuffered more then all the reſt, he (I ſay) knew Chriſt, and the vertue of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his afflictions onely in part, not perfectly, therefore none of all the faithfull children of God in this life either knowes Chriſt, or dies to ſinne, or liues to God, or is conformed by afflictions and ſufferings vnto Chriſt his death perfectly, but only in part. Yes ſurely the reaſon holds moſt ſtrongly, <hi>Pauls</hi> prerogatiues being not any way inferiour to any of the beſt and moſt faithfull children of God. Now the reaſon why in this life our knowledge, our loue, our faith, our death vnto ſinne, our life vnto God, our whole obedience, all our righteouſneſſe, all our holineſſe is in part only, why theſe things in this life are not perfect in any of the children of God, the reaſon (I ſay) is becauſe our regeneration and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in this life are not perfect, wee are not perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the ſpirit of our mindes, God giueth vnto vs the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by meaſure:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3.</note> for vnto Chriſt alone hath God giuen the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit without meaſure, but vnto euery one of vs hee hath giuen the ſpirit by meaſure. Hee is made of God vnto vs wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification: in him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of theſe things plentifully; and of his fulneſſe we all receiue, not fulneſſe of his fulneſſe, but of his fulneſſe of the ſpirit and all ſpirituall graces wee receiue as it were the firſt fruits of the ſpirit and of all ſpirituall graces, wherewith then only wee ſhall be filled, when mortalitie ſhall put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, and when corruption ſhall put on incorruption. Which the Apoſtle alſo witneſſeth, where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12</note> that <hi>now wee ſee through a glaſſe darkly, but then ſhall wee ſee face to face: now wee
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:599:370"/> know in part, but then ſhall wee know euen as wee are knowne:</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in this life in part and imperfectly, and then onely when wee ſhall ſee Chriſt face to face, ſhall we know him perfectly. For when that which is perfect is come, then ſhall that which is in part be aboliſhed, but not before. Neither is it only ſo in our knowledge, but in our faith, in our loue, euen in our whole obedience. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe while he liues ſhall haue meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, hee ſhall haue prickes in the fleſh, and hee ſhall feele a law in his members rebelling againſt the law of his minde, and leading him captiue vnto the law of ſinne which is in his members.</p>
                  <p>Here then firſt is notably confuted that imaginarie perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which ſome dreame that the children of God may haue in this life. This holy Apoſtle attained not vnto the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either of the knowledge of Chriſt, or of obedience vnto his will: what perfection then can there be in any of Gods children in this life? They ſay that no man indeede can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to that abſolute perfection either of that knowledge, or of that righteouſneſſe which ſhall be in heauen, but that they may attaine vnto ſuch perfection as is required in this life. As if either God might not require of vs in this life ſuch perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he gaue vnto vs in our creation, or as if where ſuch rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of ſinne and ignorance are as ſticke faſt vnto vs, there could be ſuch perfection.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22.</note> For I demand, hath God conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all vnder ſinne?

And what was our perfection then? Now that ignorance hath blinded vs, and ſinne hath defiled vs, haue we ſuch perfection now?

True it is, wee are often exhorted to be perfect, but thoſe exhortations onely ſhew vnto vs what perfection ſhould be in vs, not what perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is in vs. Yea the whole Law is a perfect rule not of that wee doe, but of that wee ſhould doe, and of that which God may require of vs. All our perfection is only in Chriſt Ieſus, who hath perfectly fulfilled that which wee ſhould, but could not, and for whoſe ſake all our imperfections are couered, and not imputed vnto vs. He is our perfection, wee are full of imperfections, and in his perfection are all our imperfections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>But I follow]</hi> Here I note the Apoſtles eager purſuit after perfection. He had not yet attained vnto it, but he followed as eagerly after it, as the perſecutor who will not reſt till he haue him whom he perſecuteth; or as the runner, who will not reſt till he come at his goales end. He was ſo deſirous to grow daily more and more in the knowledge of Chriſt, and of the vertue of his reſurrection &amp;c, that he ſhooke of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments and letts which might hinder him in that courſe, and laboured daily more and more in all things to grow vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which is the head, that is Chriſt. Whence I obſerue a neceſſarie dutie for all Chriſtians, which is that they labour daily more and more to grow vp in the knowledge of Chriſt, in obedience to his will, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and in all things to aime euermore at the marke of perfection. And to this purpoſe are thoſe often exhortations, <hi>Be yee perfit,

                  <p>Here then firſt they are iuſtly to be reproued that either care not at all to know Chriſt, and the vertue of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp;c: or if they haue a litle knowledge content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with that, and neuer thirſt to increaſe with the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God. Too too many ſuch careleſſe and carnall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians there be, as know not, nor care to know the things that belong vnto their peace. They follow, and they eagerly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: but what? honors, riches, pleaſures, worldly commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: they follow not with the Apoſtle the knowledge of Chriſt &amp;c: they care not for God, neither is God in all their thoughts. Other too too careleſſe Chriſtians likewiſe there be, that thinking they haue ſome knowledge content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with that, and greatly ſeeke not after more. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come not at Church, they come not at Sermons, or now and then when they liſt: ſome of them know as much as the Preacher can tell them; and ſome of them know as much as will ſerue their turne. But they know nothing as they ought to know, vnleſſe their knowledge worke in them a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting deſire after more knowledge: for hereby ſhall we know that we know Chriſt, if we eagerly long in our ſoules to haue
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:599:372"/> this knowledge of Chriſt daily more and more increaſed in vs. If then we will haue this teſtimonie vnto our owne ſoules that we haue attained vnto ſome knowledge of Chriſt, let vs labour with the Apoſtle, that we may comprehend and catch hold of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, as perfectly as he hath comprehended and caught hold of vs, if wee belong vnto him. Let vs labour daily more and more to grow from grace to grace, from ſtrength to ſtrength, from knowledge to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, till we come vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulnes of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, here is another notable comfort for ſuch of Gods children as are troubled with the conſideration of their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Thou feeleſt thine imperfections: it is well. Doeſt thou long in thy ſoule after perfection? Deſireſt thou to be fulfilled with the knowledge of Gods will in all wiſdome, and ſpirituall vnderſtanding? Wouldeſt thou gladly grow vp in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus? Doth the conſideration of thine imperfections ſet thee vnto God in prayer, vnto him that he will disburden thee of thy wants, that he will ſhew forth the light of his louing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vnto thee, &amp; that he will guide thy feet into the way of peace? All the world could not ſet thee in a better courſe to perfection. It is the way that the Apoſtle hath chalked before thee: who hauing not attained vnto perfection, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, and followed after it. Let not thine imperfections then trouble thee: None of Gods children but they haue their imperfections. If thou (though in great imperfection) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low toward the marke for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus, thou haſt great cauſe of comfort.</p>

But I haue had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heretofore, and ſhall haue hereafter to ſpeake of this point.</p>

When the ſcholar hath a good opinion of himſelfe, and thinkes that he knowes all things, the Maſter doth not alwaies repreſſe his arrogancie by telling him that hee doth not know many things whereof hee vainely boaſteth, but ſometimes he ſaith vnto him, well I count not my ſelfe that I haue attained to the knowledge of all things, and ſo by his owne example bringeth his ſcholar to a more modeſt conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Euen ſo the Miniſter of Chriſt Ieſus labouring to repreſſe ſuch faults as doe ariſe is not alwaies plainely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his ſpeech vnto them that offend, and barely to note their faults, but ſometimes he is onely to propoſe himſelfe as a patterne whereby they may reforme themſelues. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is great wiſedome in the miniſter required, to know when plainely to note, and when onely to inſinuate ſuch faults as are to be reformed. And this wiſedome they want that either cenſure all men, and all faults alike, or note them and their faults more ſharply, whom, and whoſe faults they ſhould touch with more mildneſſe. And how much this wiſedome is wanting might eaſily be ſhewed, if I might in this place as fitly ſpeake of it as there is iuſt and great occaſion to ſpeake of it.

And this was the one thing that was needfull, that when he was preaching, ſhee ſhould come and heare him, Other things ſhee might doe at other times, but now ſhee was to doe this. But not many of vs conſider this: for when Ieſus comes into our houſes almoſt in his Miniſters preaching, ſo that if wee will but come out of our doores to heare him, wee may ſit downe at his feet, and heare his preaching, yet wee cannot attend it; either wee haue no leiſure, or elſe wee haue no liſt.

                  <p>Here then we learne why it is that ſo few runne as they ought in the Chriſtian race. The moſt part of men haue an other marke that they runne at. Some runne at riches, ſome
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:599:387"/> at honors, ſome at pleaſures, ſome at eaſe, ſome at skill and knowledge in the things that are done vnder the Sunne, and on theſe things are their eyes ſet, and their mindes wholly bent. But the leaſt ſumme make Chriſt Ieſus the marke whereat they runne; to know him is the thing whereon the feweſt mindes are bent: He is fartheſt out of light, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt out of minde with the moſt men. Not running then a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the right marke, how can we but runne amiſſe? Beloued, yee ſee what the marke is whereat we ſhould ayme in the whole courſe of our life. Let the children of this world pricke at their ſeuerall markes as they liſt; but let vs follow hard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the marke Chriſt Ieſus. He is that marke whereat if we be Chriſtians we ſhould ayme in our whole race. Let our eyes be ſtill ſet, and our mindes alwaies bent vpon him. If wee walke towards him he will direct our goings in his paths <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for his owne names ſake. A better marke we cannot haue, and another marke we ought not to haue. There is no run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if we runne as we ought, but to him; neither any run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him, but by him. Let vs therefore by him runne vnto him, and in all things let vs ſtill looke vnto him. The race is well runne when at the races end we come to ſuch a marke; and well may we runne through cold and nakednes, through ſtripes and impriſonments, and all kinde of difficulties to come to ſuch a marke: whereunto we can no ſooner come, but ſtraight we haue the prize for which we runne, euen glory and immortalitie in the higheſt heauens. Let vs therefore ſo runne that we may obtaine, let vs runne till we come vnto the marke, that we may obtaine the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus. And let this ſuffice to be ſpoken touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond qualitie of runners.</p>
                  <p>The third qualitie of runners whereby the Apoſtle makes proofe of his inceſſant running in his Chriſtian race, is this, that runners keeping in minde the price for which they runne, make haſte vnto the marke for the price that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.

How? to renounce all confidence in the fleſh, to iudge all our owne righteouſnes by workes whatſoeuer to be but dung, to reioyce only in Chriſt Ieſus, and his righteouſneſſe which is through faith, to thirſt after the knowledge of Chriſt, and of the vertue of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and acknowledging our want of perfection in the knowledge of Chriſt, inceſſantly to runne forward in the Chriſtian race vnto perfection forgetting that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and endeauouring our ſelues vnto that which is before, and following hard towards the marke for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus, let vs be thus minded, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as many of vs as be perfect. Yea, but who were thoſe? were there any ſuch? Did not the Apoſtle immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deny that he was perfect? How then doth he now ſay, <hi>let vs as many as be perfect &amp;c.</hi> We muſt vnderſtand that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth not here ſpeake of any that were perfect indeed either in knowledge, or in obedience, but he ſpeaketh partly vnto thoſe that thought they were perfect, and partly vnto thoſe that by their holy walking ſhewed that they were in the way to perfection, that both they that thought themſelues perfect, and they likewiſe that by their holy walking ſhewed plainely that they were in a better way to perfection than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, would thinke as he did touching the points before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and controuerſed betwixt him and the falſe Teachers. Yea but is not his exhortation generally vnto all? Why then doth he require it of them that be perfect? His exhortation is indeed generall vnto all that all would thinke as hee did touching the points mentioned before from verſe 3. to this 15. But leſt any man ſhould thinke that he ſpake eſpecially vnto the vulgar ſort of men, and preſcribed this rule only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that were babes in Chriſt, therefore he ſheweth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely that this is a rule which whoſoeuer among them thought himſelfe to be, or were more perfect than others ought to keepe, euen to be ſo minded as <hi>Paul</hi> was in the things
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:599:390"/> mentioned aboue. And beſides it was not ſo needfull to ſpeak vnto them by name as it were that knew and acknowledged their owne wants, that they ſhould not thinke themſelues perfect, as to them that either thought themſelues, or were thought of others to be perfect. Vnto them principally as by name the admonition was moſt needfull that they ſhould be ſo minded as <hi>Paul</hi> was, as in the reſt of the points, ſo in the acknowledgement of their owne imperfection, and in the purſuit after perfection. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And if ye be otherwiſe minded &amp;c.]</hi> This ſheweth that the Apoſtle thought or rather knew that he ſhould not be able to perſwade all to be of the ſame minde with him in the things mentioned, but that ſome through the ſuggeſtions of the falſe Teachers would thinke otherwiſe then hee thought of thoſe points. Yet ſee how kindly he dealeth with thoſe, <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye be otherwiſe minded</hi> ſo that ye do not yet thinke as I your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle do of theſe points, euen of Chriſtian perfection, but rather are of another iudgement, yet I doubt not but as God hath begunne to reueale his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt vnto you by my preaching, ſo hee will alſo in his good time reueale and make knowne vnto you this ſame thing wherein ye now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in iudgement from mee, and will not ſuffer you to bee holden of this error; he will I doubt not in his good time by the miniſterie of his ſeruants through the powerfull operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy ſpirit open the dimme eyes of your darke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that ye may ſee both that ye erre in this wherein ye diſſent from me, and that this is the truth whereunto I now exhort you. To gather then the ſumme of the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in theſe words, it is as much as if the Apoſtle had thus ſaid: I am thus minded, as I haue told you, touching mine owne righteouſnes which is by workes, touching the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt which is through faith, and touching Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfection in generall. Let vs therefore euen all of vs, not only thoſe which are but babes in Chriſt, or of the vulgar ſort, but euen as many as either think our ſelues, or are thought by others to be perfect be thus minded as I am touching theſe points: and if any of you diſſent in iudgement from mee, and doe not thinke as I doe touching Chriſtian perfection.
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:599:390"/> God will, no doubt, in his good time by the miniſterie of his ſeruants through the powerfull working of the holy Ghoſt open the dimme eyes of your darke vnderſtanding, that ye may ſee both your owne error in diſſenting from me, and the truth of that whereunto I exhort you.

Hence then I obſerue what Chriſtian perfection is, namely a gift of the holy Ghoſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we renounce the fleſh, reioyce in Chriſt, and haue ſuch a ſenſe of the knowledge of Chriſt, and of the vertue of his reſurrection in our ſelues, that acknowledging our want of perfection therein we labour to grow and encreaſe daily more and more therein, and ſo inceſſantly runne after perfection in them, that as good runners we forget that which is behind, and endeauour our ſelues to that which is before, and follow hard towards the marke for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus. So that vnto Chriſtian perfection there are foure things neceſſarily requiſite. The firſt whereof is, iuſtification by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to vs through faith without workes. For ſo onely are we perfit if we be found in Chriſt Ieſus, not hauing our owne righteouſnes which is by workes, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, euen the righteouſneſſe of God through faith. And therefore the Apoſtle telleth the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in the next Epiſtle,

And in the next Chapter he telleth them that they are compleate in Chriſt, in whom dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the godhead bodily.

                  <p>The ſecond vſe which we may make of the former obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, that thence we may learne to trie what perfection we are growne vnto in the ſchoole of Chriſt. For doe wee reioyce only in Chriſt Ieſus, renouncing all our owne righteouſneſſe which is by workes, and quietly repoſing our ſelues in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe through faith in his bloud? Doe wee feele in our ſelues a dying vnto ſinne, and a liuing vnto God in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe through the vertue of Chriſt his death and reſurrection, by the power of the ſpirit regenerating vs vnto a liuely hope in Chriſt Ieſus? Doe wee in our ſoules feele and from our hearts acknowledge our regeneration and our ſanctification by the contagion of the fleſh to be ſo vnperfect, as that wee finde in our ſelues many wants and many imperfections? Doe wee labour and endeuour to grow in grace and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to be perfect as he is perfect, to be holy as hee is holy, and to proceed from ſtrength to ſtrength vntill we become perfect men in Chriſt Ieſus? Here is the ſubſtance of that perfection which o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> good God requireth of vs in this life. If it be thus with vs, we may aſſure our ſelues that we haue well profited in the ſchoole of Chriſt, and that we are growne vnto very good perfection. There was a time indeed when it was ſaid vnto vs, <hi>This doe, and thou ſhalt liue;</hi> and againe, <hi>Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all things that are written in the booke of the law to doe them</hi> and in this time there was no perfection but in the perfect fulfilling of the whole Law of God; ſo that all of vs were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe, and all of vs were in thrall vnto that mortall enemie of mankinde the deuill, becauſe it was impoſſible for vs to fulfill the Law of God. But when it pleaſed the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting King of glory in infinite mercy towards vs to ſend his owne Sonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull man for ſinne to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demne ſinne in the fleſh, then this thrall vnto Satan, this curſe of the Law, this yoke of the Law which neither we nor our fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers were able to beare, was taken from our ſhoulders: for that which the Law required of vs, but which was impoſſible for vs to performe,<note place="margin">

                  <p>A bleſſed ſending of ſuch a Sonne, and a bleſſed birth of ſo ſweet a Sauiour, worthy to be celebrated by a perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance for euer. The ſending of him vnto vs was the greateſt token that euer was of God the Fathers loue towards vs; and his comming into the world in the ſimilitude of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleſh was the ioyfulleſt comming that euer was; ſo ioyfull, that an Angell from heauen brought the tidings thereof, and therein of great ioy that ſhould be to all people; that a multi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tude of heauenly ſouldiers praiſed God thereat, and ſaid, <hi>Glory be to God in the high heauens, and peace in earth, and towards men good will;</hi> that certaine wiſe men came then from the Eaſt Country to worſhip him; that the ſhepheards when they had ſeene the babe with his mother, publiſhed abroad the thing that was told them by the Angell of that childe; that <hi>Simeon</hi> taking him in his armes, praiſed God and ſaid, <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſeruant depart in peace, &amp;c.</hi> and that <hi>Anna</hi> ſpake of him to all that looked for redemption in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Of which moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So did they celebrate his birth as wee haue heard, and ſo ſhould wee celebrate the remembrance of his birth. All other celebration is rather an heatheniſh imitation then any religious obſeruation. Let vs therefore as at all other times, ſo at this time ſound out his praiſes in the middeſt of the great congregation, who hauing fulfilled that for vs in his fleſh which wee could not, doth now require of vs no more

For, as I told you before, this is the ſubſtance of that perfection which God requireth of vs in this life. Howbeit, this withall wee muſt note, that there be degrees in this perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for when by Gods mercy we are come ſo farre, that the ſpirit beareth witneſſe vnto our ſpirit, that in ſome meaſure we haue attained vnto all theſe points of Chriſtian perfection, yet may we not here ſtand ſtill, but we muſt goe forward from grace vnto grace. Vntill wee come vnto the marke at our ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces end wee muſt runne forward, and daily grow from perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to perfection. We muſt labour daily to increaſe in faith, that we may daily more and more be eſtabliſhed in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt. We muſt daily ſubdue the fleſh vnto the ſpirit, that wee may daily more and more be begotten by the ſpirit vnto a more liuely hope in Chriſt Ieſus. We muſt daily caſt downe our ſelues before the Lord, that hee may daily more and more lift vs vp. We muſt daily follow hard towards the marke, that wee may be daily more and more holy in all manner of conuerſation. And therefore it is that wee doe ſo often communicate at the Lords Table, namely that our faith and obedience may by degrees bee daily more and more ſtrengthned and increaſed. There needs but once entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church by the Sacrament of Baptiſme; but being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Church, our ſoules muſt be often fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſhed vnto euerlaſting life by the Sacrament of the Lords

This I take to be the true meaning of theſe words. Now let vs ſee what hence wee may learne, and ſo wee will proceed vnto that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the next verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And if yee be otherwiſe minded, &amp;c.] Ambroſe</hi> one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers readeth theſe words thus, <hi>And if yee ſhall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, God alſo hath reuealed it,</hi> and vnderſtandeth them as if the Apoſtle had thus ſaid, If yee ſhall thinke of any more then I haue put you in minde of, know that it is by reuelation from God. Which ſenſe and reading if it were true, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed helpe well to boulſter out ſuch humane traditions and ſuperſtitious ceremonies as the Church is burdened and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered withall. But this ſenſe and reading as well becauſe it may ſeeme to patronage ſuch vnwritten verities, and vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory ceremonies, as alſo for that it is altogether different from the words and meaning of the Apoſtle, is vtterly to be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. For firſt the Apoſtle doth not ſay, if you ſhall be, but if ye be otherwiſe minded. Againe, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, God hath reuealed it, but God ſhall or will reueale it vnto you. And laſtly, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If yee be otherwiſe minded,</hi> his meaning is not that if they thinke more then hee hath put them in minde of, but his meaning is, that if they thinke not as he doth touching the points mentioned, but differ from him in iudgement, yet God will alſo reueale this truth vnto them as he hath done other truths.</p>
                  <p>My note hence in briefe is, that we are to take heed how we take things vpon the credit of the ancient Fathers. The Lord
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:599:396"/> is greatly to be bleſſed for them, and it is with all thankfulneſſe to be acknowledged that they by their godly labours haue greatly profited Gods Church. But yet their words, and the ſenſes which they giue of the Scriptures, are to be weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuarie, and to be examined according to the Scriptures, For this by examination we ſhall finde, that diuers times they miſſe the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, and ſometimes they plainly alter the words of the holy Ghoſt. This place giueth euident witneſſe vnto both, where both the words are ſo altered, and the meaning ſo miſſed by this holy Father, as that in both he ſwarueth from the holy Ghoſt, as before was euidently ſhewed. The more to blame they th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> take a Fathers word for warrant good enough, and thinke their plea good if in the expoſition of a Scripture, or debating of a queſtion, they haue the ſuffrage and liking of one or two Fathers.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note is the manner how the Apoſtle dealeth with ſuch of the <hi>Philippians</hi> as differed from him in iudgement euen in theſe points of righteouſneſſe and ſaluation He doth not by and by deſpaire of them, or reiect them as heretikes, or thunder our ſharpe threatnings againſt them, but in all mildneſſe of ſpirit ſignifieth his hope that God will reueale their errour vnto them, that they which now are otherwiſe minded then he is, may be of the ſame minde that he is. But withall we muſt note what manner men they were with whom the Apoſtle dealt thus kindly. They were no ſuch men as wilfully oppoſed themſelues againſt the truth, or ſuch as were ſo vtterly bewitched that they would not obey the truth, but ſuch as hauing not long ſince embraced the truth by his preaching, were now a little ſeduced, and drawne aſide by ſuch falſe teachers as were crept in amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Whence I obſerue that we are for a time to beare with the ignorance of our weake brethren, and to reteine a good hope of them though they doe not wholly ſubſcribe vnto that truth which we embrace. This alſo our Apoſtle teacheth vs to doe where he ſaith,<note place="margin">

Were we not all ignorant of the waies of God, and of the things that belong vnto our peace? Yes ſurely vntill the day-ſtarre, euen the ſunne of righteouſneſſe aroſe in our hearts, our mindes were full of darkneſſe, and the way of truth we knew not. For as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man</hi> (whoſe vnderſtanding is not yet cleared by Gods ſpirit, <hi>perceiueth not the things of the ſpirit of God, but they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him.</hi> Hath then the Lord in his great mercy towards me made my darkneſſe to be light, and brought me to the knowledge of his truth, and ſhut him as yet vp in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and in ignorance? Or, hath the Lord brought vs both to the knowledge of his truth, and hath he ſuffered him by occaſion to fall from the way of truth, and ſuſteined me by the ſtrength of his holy ſpirit? And ſhall I in either of theſe caſes inſult ouer him, contemne or diſdeine him, determine, or iudge raſhly of him to be a forlorne man, an Atheiſt, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate? Or am I not rather, bending the knees of my ſoule vnto the Lord for his mercies towards me, to hope that in his
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:599:397"/> good time he will lighten his vnderſtanding that was ſhut vp in ignorance, or raiſe him vp againe that was fallen, and in the meane time to beare with the ignorance of the one, and the error of the other? Yes my brethren, ſo long as their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth is vntainted with cankred malice againſt the truth, we may hope that the Lord will call them at the ſixt or ninth or ſome good houre, and reueale his holy truth vnto them, and in the meane time we are to beare with them, and to ſupport one another through loue. And for this cauſe, the holy Apoſtles, when the word which they preached was vnto them that heard them as water powred vpon a ſtone, yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to inſtruct them with all patience, hoping that God would reueale the things vnto them which as yet were h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> from their eyes.</p>
                  <p>This then ſhould teach vs not to deſpaire of them vnto whom the Lord hath not yet reuealed ſome part of his truth, nor to withhold from them ſuch wholeſome inſtructions and admonitions as may draw them from that ignorance or error wherewith they are holden, but in all godly ſort to labour with them, prouing if at any time God will open their eyes that they may turne from darknes vnto light, from the power of Satan vnto God. The Miniſter is after the example of our Apoſtle to inſtruct with all patience them that be ignorant, and them that be contrarily minded in that truth of Chriſt Ieſus which hee hath learned, and to deale with them to be like minded as he is; and if they be otherwiſe minded, yet to labour with them, and to hope that God will reueale the truth vnto them. Others likewiſe whoſe eyes the Lord hath opened to know things that are ſpiritually diſcerned, ſhould labour to draw them on vnto the ſame truth with them. And therefore beſides other duties which they ſhould performe vnto them, when they goe vp vnto the houſe of the Lord, they ſhould ſay vnto them as they in <hi>Eſay,</hi>

<pb n="782" facs="tcp:599:402"/> a ſchiſme in the Church. What a ſtirre made <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> in the congregation of Iſraell? And whence was it?

                     <hi>Yee take too much vpon you, ſeeing al the congregation is holy, euery one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherefore then lift ye vp your ſelues aboue the congregation of the Lord?</hi> What contentions likewiſe were there in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and how did they one ſwell againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.11.4.21.</note> And whence was it?

This diſtraction in minde and iudgement bredde among them ſo great diſſenſions, as that it may ſeeme to haue beene one ſpeciall cauſe why the Apoſtle wrote the former Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> euen to repreſſe their diſſenſions cauſed by their diſtractions in minde, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They doe not charge vs with corruption of doctrine, but becauſe of ſome things in ſome ceremonies, and in our outward diſcipline they cannot, they ſay, be of one minde with vs, and therefore they breake out from vs. Thus ye ſee what the cauſes of the diſſenſions in the Church of God are, at leaſt ſuch as this place of Scripture ſeemeth vnto mee to point at. The 1. becauſe in things that are not yet reuealed vnto vs we doe not with patience expect and waite till God in his good time reueale vnto vs that truth which as yet is hidde from our eyes.

As many of vs therefore as loue the peace of <hi>Sion,</hi> let vs be knit together in one minde, and in one iudgement in the Lord, let vs ſpeake one thing, and let vs be of like affection one towards another. So ſhall the peace of our <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> bee as the light of the Sunne, and her proſperitie as the noone day. Let vs by all meanes auoid all diſſenſions and diuiſions, and endeuour to keepe the vnitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace. And therefore in the things that are not yet reuealed vnto vs, let vs with patience wait till God in his good time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale them vnto vs; let vs in the things that are reuealed vnto vs proceed by one rule, that one rule of Gods word, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from it to the right hand, or to the left, and let vs bee like minded one towards another according to Chriſt Ieſus, that with one minde and one mouth we may praiſe God, euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

                  <p>The third thing which I note, is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that whereunto wee are come let vs proceed by one rule, &amp;c.</hi> which ſheweth, that howſoeuer one came ſhort of another, yet hee would haue euery one of them ſo farre as they were come to
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:599:404"/> goe forward, and as in marching againſt the enemie the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to encourage the weaker, and the weaker to ranke with the ſtronger, and both to proceed by one rule of their great Generall Chriſt Ieſus. Whence I obſerue, that neither they that are weaker then others in faith, in knowledge, or in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, are to be diſcouraged, or to ſit them downe becauſe they are weake, nor they that are ſtronger then others in faith, in knowledge, or in obedience, are to bee puft vp in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or to contemne them that are weaker becauſe they are ſtronger, but euery man is according to the meaſure of grace that is giuen him to walke by that rule which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him, and one to helpe another in fighting a good fight, and finiſhing their courſe. All of vs are ranked to runne, and billed to fight, albeit vnto all of vs be not giuen like ſpeed to runne, or like ſtrength to fight, and all of vs muſt runne and fight, though we cannot runne with the ſpeedieſt, or fight with the ſtrongeſt. And ſhall wee either be diſcouraged and ſit downe becauſe we cannot match with the beſt, or ſwell and diſdaine becauſe we are not as others, but as good as the beſt? It is as if the foot ſhould be diſmaied and denie to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the head; and as if the head ſhould diſdaine to direct the ſteps becauſe it is aboue the foot. The father of the childe that was poſſeſſed with a dumbe ſpirit, ſaw (no doubt) his owne weakneſſe to be great when our Sauiour ſaid vnto him, <hi>If thou canſt beleeue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>all things are poſſible to him that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</hi> Yet he fainted not, but holding on a good courſe hee ſaid, <hi>Lord I beleeue, helpe mine vnbeleefe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">24.</note> And our holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle knew right well how ſtrong he was in the ſpirit, and how he abounded in the graces of the ſpirit: yet hee diſdained not to become as weake vnto the weake,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22.</note> that he might winne the weake, and gaine them vnto Chriſt. And both theſe marched in their ranke, and fought well, inaſmuch as the weake fainted not becauſe he was weake, nor hee that was ſtrong diſdained not the weake becauſe he was ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>Let no man therefore be diſcouraged or faint becauſe he is weake and vnable to runne with the formoſt. Some in march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward muſt be before, and ſome behinde. Let not him that is behinde faint, but march forward. Let him march af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:599:405"/> the rule preſcribed him by his Generall, let his word be a lanterne vnto his feet, and a light vnto his paths, to direct his going in the way of his commandements. To haue ſtrength to runne with the formoſt is a great grace of God, and to bee ſought after by all manner praier and ſupplication in the ſpirit. But if thou walke forward in that weakneſſe of thine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of grace that is giuen thee by the rule which thy God hath preſcribed thee, this ſhall bring thee peace at the laſt, and guide thee vnto the hauen where thou wouldeſt be. Let not thine heart therefore bee troubled nor feare. In what weakneſſe ſoeuer it is that thou walkeſt, bleſſe thy God that hath ſet thee in the way, and proceed as hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth grace in the way.</p>

Becauſe there were many ill walkers whoſe example if they followed they were to looke for the like end that is deſtined vnto them, euen damnation: ſuch as were thoſe whom in the beginning of this Chapter he called dogges, euill workers, the conciſion; whom hee now againe deſcribeth by fiue notes; As 1. th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

In that he ſaith <hi>many walke,</hi> hee ſignifieth the more danger of them becauſe they are many.

Againe, in that he noteth <hi>them to be the enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> he ſignifieth their corruption in doctrine, and in life. In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for that by vrging the neceſſity of circumciſion and the workes of the Law vnto righteouſneſſe and ſaluation, they made the croſſe of Chriſt to bee of no effect, and aboliſhed the worke of our redemption by Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>For,</hi>

In both theſe then, that by their doctrine they detracted from the merits of Chriſt his Croſſe, and redemption by his bloud, and auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſuffer perſecution for the croſſe of Chriſt, the ſmart whereof they felt that ſincerely preached Chriſt crucified, in both theſe I ſay they ſhewed themſelues to be enemies vnto the croſſe of Chriſt. Againe, in that he noteth their end or reward for the recompence of ſuch their walking to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or deſtruction, he ſignifieth how needfull it is for the <hi>Philippians</hi> if they feare their end to feare likewiſe ſo to walke as they do, ſo to beleeue and liue as they doe. Againe, in that he noteth <hi>their God to be their belly,</hi> he ſignifieth what princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally they reſpected in preaching of Chriſt, namely their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, their pleaſure, and their eaſe. They preached Chriſt, not ſincerely, and purely, for Chriſt his ſake, but with reference to pleaſe others, and to ſeeke their owne good. Inaſmuch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they were louers of pleaſure, of profit, of eaſe more than louers of good, the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>that their God was their belly,</hi> that being each mans God which he beſt loueth. Again, in that he noteth their glory to be to <hi>their ſhame,</hi> he ſignifieth either that they glory in thoſe things as in circumciſion, and the ordinances of <hi>Moſes</hi> whereof they ought rather to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, as ſome thinke, or that the vaine glory and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they ſeeke after amongſt men, neglecting the true glory of Chriſt Ieſus ſhal turne to their confuſion and ſhame, as I rather thinke the words to be vnderſtood. Laſtly, in that
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:599:412"/> he noteth <hi>them to minde earthly things,</hi> he ſignifieth their ſtudy and delight, and all their affections to be ſet on honours, wealth, friends, commodities, and the things which are on the earth, and not on the things which are aboue.

Aſſure your ſelues the danger is great if yee doe not hearken, and the puniſhment of your ſinne lieth at your doore, if you reforme not that ſinne whatſoeuer it be whereof yee are ſo often told. Looke well therefore vnto it whenſoeuer yee are often told of any thing to be reformed, and thinke not with your ſelues that it is but a ſmall matter, and that there needs not halfe ſo much adoe about it; but perſwade your ſelues that it much concerneth you to redreſſe it. And whether it be for any manner of thing to be reformed, or for any kinde of perſon to be auoided, deferre not too long to hearken to that which is told ſo often.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this often telling you of the ſame thing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or auoyded, may put you in minde of that naturall corruption which hangeth ſo faſt on you. Much ado to bring vs to the mortification of the olde man, and though we be told againe and againe of ſuch ſinnes as hold vs captiue at their owne pleaſure, yet can we be content to put of from day to day, and with the ſluggard to ſay, <hi>yet a litle ſleepe, a litle ſlumber,</hi>

Let vs therefore ſhake of this corruption, and either let vs not neede ſo often to be told of any thing, or at leaſt when we are ſo often told, let vs hearken and obey, and auoide or reforme whatſoeuer it is that we are warned and admoniſhed of. For as it is the Paſtors dutie to tell vs of things to be reformed or auoided, ſo is it our dutie to hearken and obey when we are told; and this dutie to tell vs often of ſuch things is impoſed vpon the Paſtor, becauſe of the negligent performance of our dutie to hearken and obey when we are told. Let vs therefore at all times giue all diligence to hearken vnto the things that belong vnto our peace, and to obey from the heart that forme of doctrine whereunto we are deliuered to conforme our ſelues according vnto it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note is, that the Apoſtle ſaith,
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:599:413"/> that now at the writing hereof he tells them weeping of theſe enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt. Whereby the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both his great affection towards the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and his great griefe that either there ſhould be ſuch, or that they ſhould hearken vnto ſuch. Whence I obſerue the great and godly affection which ought to be in the Paſtor towards his people, euen ſo great that it ſhould grieue him, and euen cauſe him to ſhed teares to ſee the enemies of the truth to trouble his people, or to ſee his people drawne into any ſinne or error by any that are otherwiſe then well and godly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For thus wee teſtifie generally our affection vnto the Church of God, if we be grieued to ſee it aſſaulted by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, or the Dragon any way to preuaile againſt it.

But well may ſhee ſtand on her multitude that hath made all nations drunken with the wine of the wrath of her fornications, and ſo let her doe till the ſmoke of her burning aſcend. But why or whence is it that we in our ordinarie life ſtand ſo much vpon the multitude? What more common amongſt vs then to ſay, that we will doe as the moſt doe, we will not ſingle our ſelues from the reſt, &amp;c? Nay is not that profane and wicked ſpeech often heard amongſt vs, that it is good going with companie though it be to the Deuill?

For we are not to looke how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe walke thus and thus, but who walke as they ſhould; not how many walke in this or that way, but what the way is wherein they doe walke. And though all the reſt bow the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> yet we may not; though all the nations of the earth fall downe before the beaſt and worſhip, yet may not we. What if in an election of an officer and magiſtrate, the reſt, or farre the greater part, conſent vpon an vnfit man, yet may not I.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus farre we haue already proceeded in this firſt reaſon of the Apoſtles which he vſed to moue the <hi>Philippians</hi> to follow him, and ſuch as he was; <hi>for many walke, of whom I haue told you often, and now tell you weeping &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now follow the fiue notes whereby the Apoſtle deſcribeth theſe many walkers of whom he had told them often, and now told them weeping. The firſt note whereby he deſcribeth them is, that they are the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt. Which branch of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might well ſtand for a ſufficient reaſon with the <hi>Philippians</hi> to moue them not to walke after theſe, but to follow him, and to walke ſo as they had him for an enſample. Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle calleth them the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt in two re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpects. 1. Becauſe by vrging the neceſſitie of circumciſion, and the workes of the law vnto righteouſneſſe and ſaluation, they made the croſſe of Chriſt to be of none effect, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the worke of our redemption by the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus. 2. Becauſe they would not ſuffer perſecution for the croſſe of Chriſt, and therefore applied themſelues to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Iewes, and preached vnto them circumciſion, and the law. For thus both in doctrine, detracting from the merits of Chriſt his croſſe, and redemption by his bloud; and likewiſe in life, following after carnall ſecuritie, and auoyding perſecution for Chriſt crucified, they ſhewed themſelues to be enemies vnto the croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence then I obſerue who they be that be the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, namely they that in their doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the merits of Chriſt his croſſe, and the worke of
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:599:416"/> our redemption by the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus finiſhed vpon the croſſe; and they likewiſe that in their life follow after car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall delicacie, and flie perſecution for the croſſe of Chriſt, for Chriſt crucified: euen both theſe ſorts of men are enemies vnto the croſſe of Chriſt. For touching the firſt ſort of men, muſt not they needs be counted the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, that in their doctrine make the croſſe of Chriſt to be of none effect? And doe not they in their doctrine make the croſſe of Chriſt to be of none effect, that teach righteouſnes, redemption, or ſaluation to be any otherwiſe then by the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merits of Chriſt his croſſe, and faith in his bloud? The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>if righteouſneſſe be by the Law,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21.</note> if we may be made righteous by any worke which we can doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law, by the feare of God, the loue of God, the loue of our neighbour, or any thing commanded in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law of God, <hi>then Chriſt died without a cauſe, and in vaine.</hi> For to this end, as the Apoſtle ſheweth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>God ſent his Sonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſinne condemned ſinne in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in vs.</hi> Where the meaning is, that therefore Chriſt was ſent to fulfill all righteouſneſſe in our fleſh, and to die for vs, becauſe we were vnable to fulfill the law to be made righteous by it, or to ſaue our ſoules from death. For if we had beene able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe righteouſnes by our owne workes, or to ſaue our ſoules from death, then what needed Chriſt to haue come in the fleſh, or to haue died for vs? It had beene in vaine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. They then that teach righteouſneſſe to be by the law, or any thing that we can doe, they make the death of Chriſt, and his reſurrection, his victorie, his kingdome, his glory, himſelfe vnprofitable, and of none effect, and ſo are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the croſſe of Chriſt. So againe, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>yee are aboliſhed from Chriſt, whoſoeuer are iuſtified by the law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>yee are fallen from grace.</hi> Where the meaning is, that they are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly voide of Chriſt, and not in the kingdome of grace, they aboliſh righteouſneſſe, redemption, and ſaluation by Chriſt and haue no part in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, that ſeeke to be made righteous, or to purchaſe ſaluation by the works of the law.

                     </gap> doctrine are iniurious to the croſſe of Chriſt. Who are they that teach, that we are iuſtified by our owne works done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, and not by the alone righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus which he finiſhed vpon his croſſe? Who are they that teach that our ſinnes are forgiuen by bulls, and pardons, and pilgrimages, and not by the alone bloud of Chriſt Ieſus? Who are they that teach propitiatorie ſacrifices for the quicke and the dead, other then that one ſacrifice of Chriſt Ieſus once offered vpon the croſſe, whereby he hath obtained eternall redemption for vs? Who are they that teach invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation vnto, and interceſſion by Saints or Angels, or any other then him that by his owne bloud hath entred in once vnto the holy place, and is ſet at the right hand of God to make continuall interceſſion for vs? Marke who they be that be ſuch, and ſee whether that they be not the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, whether any be ſo iniurious vnto the croſſe of Chriſt as they be. O but ſome will ſay that theſe whom I now note be the onely friends of the croſſe of Chriſt. For doe not they worſhip the croſſe of Chriſt euen with holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Doe not they ſet it in their temples, &amp; in the high waies, and in euery place bow downe vnto it? Doe not they adorne it with gold, and ſiluer, and all coſtly precious ſtones? Doe not their great ones cauſe it in all celebritie and pompe to be caried before them? Doe they not at all times, when they come out of their houſes, when they come into the Churches, when they addreſſe themſelues almoſt vnto any thing ſigne themſelues with the ſigne of the croſſe in honor of the croſſe of Chriſt? True it is, they whom I note doe thus, and yet theſe be they that be the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt. For to doe thus, and with theſe fooliſh outward ſemblances and may-games to deceiue the world, is not to glory in the croſſe
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:599:417"/> of Chriſt, or to be a friend of the croſſe of Chriſt; but to teach Chriſt Ieſus purely and ſincerely, to giue vnto Chriſt crucified the full and whole honor of our redemption, iuſtification, and ſaluation which they doe not, this is to be a true friend of the croſſe of Chriſt: for this is to beleeue and know Chriſt crucified. There was a time indeed when the croſſe of Chriſt was moſt odious and opprobrious, and when to preach or beleeue in Chriſt crucified was moſt ridiculous. And if theſe croſſe and groſſe idolaters had liued then, it may well be thought that they would haue beene croſſe and groſſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. But now when we glory in nothing more than to know Chriſt and him crucified, in ſuch pompous ſort and vaine ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſticulations to celebrate the croſſe, and to detract from the merits of Chriſt crucified, is to be iniurious vnto the croſſe of Chriſt, to be an enemie of the croſſe of Chriſt. Yea what elſe is ſuch adoration and worſhip of the croſſe as they vſe, but moſt groſſe and impious idolatry? Take heede therefore of ſuch: marke well who they be. Many ſuch there be: but take heede and beware of them; <hi>for they are the enemies &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another ſort of men likewiſe there are enemies vnto the croſſe of Chriſt, and thoſe are ſuch as in their life follow after carnall delicacies, and flie perſecution for the croſſe of Chriſt, for Chriſt crucified. Of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, where he ſaith, <hi>As many as deſire to make a faire ſhew in the fleſh,</hi>

                     <hi>they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine you to be circumciſed, only becauſe they would not ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for the croſſe of Chriſt.</hi> In which place the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cauſe why the falſe teachers preached and vrged cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and the Law. And this it was: The Iewes ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected both vnto our Sauiour Chriſt, and vnto his Apoſtles that they taught things contrary to the Law, and to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>Moſes:</hi> for ſo wee ſee it was in the accuſation of our Sauiour before his arraignment, that hee moued the people,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 6.14.</note> that hee preached that Ieſus of <hi>Nazaret</hi> ſhould change the ordinances which <hi>Moſes</hi> gaue them. And for this they were ready to kill <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">21.28.</note> that hee taught as they ſaid all men euery where againſt

The falſe teachers therefore ſeeing that the Iewes ſtood vpon <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Law, and that they perſecuted them that preached Chriſt ſincerely euen to the death, ioyned in their preaching of Chriſt circumciſion, and the Law vnto Chriſt, that ſo applying themſelues vnto the humour of the Iewes, they might auoid perſecution for the croſſe of Chriſt, or for preaching ſincerely Chriſt crucified. And theſe are they that the Apoſtle cals here the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, becauſe to pleaſe the humour of the Iewes, to liue at eaſe and pleaſure, and to auoid perſecution, they made marchandiſe of the word of God, and preached Chriſt not ſincerely, but ſo as they might keepe themſelues without gunſhot of any danger.</p>
                  <p>Will yee then know what other enemies there bee of the croſſe of Chriſt at this day, that yee may beware alſo to walke as they doe? Marke then who they are that to auoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which often followeth vpon the preaching of Chriſt purely, fit themſelues vnto the humours of men, and ſo preach that they may pleaſe, or at leaſt not diſpleaſe. Who are they that turne with euery winde, and rather then they will hazard life, goods, or name, will iumpe in religion iuſt with the King of what religion ſoeuer he be? Who are they that to auoid it may be only ſuppoſed dangers, doe betray the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, ſparing to ſpeake ſuch things as they ought, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch things as they ought not? Who are they whoſe care and labour it is a great deale more to ſpeake ſafely, as they thinke, then to ſpeake ſincerely? Many ſuch carnall Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers there be, of whom that of our Sauiour Chriſt is truly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The ſecond thing which the Apoſtle noteth in theſe many walkers of whom he had told them often, and now told them weeping, is, that their end or reward for a recompence of ſuch their walking is damnation, or deſtruction, if God ſhall not
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:599:418"/> grant them grace vnto repentance for ſuch their euill walking. Which branch of the Apoſtles reaſon in effect vrgeth thus much, that if the <hi>Philippians</hi> feared the end of thoſe walkers, they ſhould alſo feare to walke as they did, and rather walke ſo as they had him for an enſample. And indeed this end, as alſo the other properties after ſpecified, rightly agree vnto thoſe enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt before mentioned. Hence then I obſerue what the end is of thoſe that are enemies vnto the croſſe of Chriſt, that make their God their bellie, that ſeeke the praiſe of men, but not of God, that minde earthly things, ſo that their delight and affections are ſet thereon, and generally of ſuch vngodly walkers as walke cleane otherwiſe then wee haue Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles and bleſſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for an enſample: their end is, as here the Apoſtle ſaith, damnation, vnleſſe the Lord grant them grace vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. A ſentence which albeit I feare to pronounce, yet when and where the holy Ghoſt leadeth me thereunto, I muſt ſpeake, that the godly may ſtand in awe, and not ſinne, and that the vngodly of the earth may tremble, and either reforme the wickedneſſe of their wayes, or elſe through the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God may ſmite their knees one againſt another, and be drencht vp in deſperation.

If by that which hath beene ſaid yee can deſcrie who they be that be the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, or if that which ſhall be ſaid ſhall any way deſigne who they be whoſe God is their bellie, whoſe glory is to their ſhame, which minde earthly things, take heede and beware that yee walke not as they doe. For of this be ye ſure, that the end of ſuch is damnation and deſtruction. And if the Cities about <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> ſuffered the vengeance of eternall fire as well as <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi>

Take heede therefore leſt at any time any of you be deceiued by them, and walke not in their ſteps if yee will not bee partakers of their iudgements.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which the Apoſtle noteth in theſe inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate walkers, is, that their God is their bellie: whereby the Apoſtle ſignifieth that they preached not Chriſt ſincerely and purely for Chriſt his ſake, but that they principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in the preaching of Chriſt their profit, their pleaſure, their eaſe, being louers of pleaſures, of profit, of eaſe, more then louers of God; and therefore their bellie, that is, their profit, their pleaſure, their eaſe, might well bee called their God, that being each mans God which hee loueth and liketh beſt. And this branch alſo of the Apoſtles reaſon might well ſtand for a ſufficient argument with the <hi>Philippians</hi> to moue them not to walke after theſe, but to follow him, and to walke ſo as they had him for an enſample. Hence then I obſerue another note of falſe teachers, after whoſe example wee may
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:599:419"/> not walke: if their God be their bellie, ſo that they care more to ſerue their owne bellies then the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, they are falſe teachers, and we may not follow them. This note of falſe teachers our Apoſtle alſo giues in his epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> where hauing exhorted the <hi>Romans</hi> to beware of falſe Apoſtles and teachers, he giues them this note to know them by, <hi>They that are ſuch,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſerue not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but their owne bellies,</hi> that is, they ſeeke their owne gaine, and preach Chriſt with reference to pleaſe others, and to ſeeke their owne eaſe, profit, and pleaſure. The Apoſtle giues like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame note of them,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14 3.</note> where he ſaith that <hi>they haue hearts exerciſed with couetouſneſſe, through couetouſneſſe making mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of mens ſoules.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Balaam,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> there ſaith, that <hi>he loued the wages of vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Will yee then know who they are at this day that by this note may be deſcried to be falſe teachers, that knowing them ye may not follow them, nor walke as they doe? Marke then who they are that ſerue their owne bellies more then the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Who are they that through couetouſneſſe would make marchandize of your ſoules, and ſpeake euill of the way of truth? Who are they that for money ſet on ſale the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, and the kingdome of heauen? Who are they that vnder colour of long praiers deuoure widowes houſes? that for ſuch and ſuch lands, or ſummes of money, or releefe to ſuch and ſuch places, will promiſe ſo many praiers for ſo many dayes or yeeres for you or your friends? Who are they that to maintaine their triple Crowne maintaine alſo the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Stewes? Who are they that make gaine godlineſſe, and doe all that euer they doe in deed and in truth for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their ſtate, and of their bellies? It is eaſily knowne who they be, and it is as eaſily hereby diſcerned that they are falſe teachers whoſoeuer they be. Take heed then and beware of them: follow them not, neither walke as they doe; for howſoeuer they haue God in their mouthes, yet ſound their
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:599:420"/> hearts, and trace them in the paths wherein they walke, it wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> God which they loue beſt, or that be their bellie which they meaſure by their pleaſure, profit, and eaſe.</p>
                  <p>But doe they alone make their belly their God? Doe not all they that more ſeeke their owne then that which is Ieſus Chriſts make their bellie their God? Or are there not many carnall Goſpellers that doe ſo? How many are there that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude themſelues into this holy calling, not with any purpoſe to worke in the Lord his vineyard, but onely to feede vpon the portion of the Leuites? How many are there that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their ſhoulders from the burthen as much and as often as they can, and take as little paines in this worke as they can, ſeeking more their owne eaſe then that which is Ieſus Chriſts? How many are there that being bewitched with the loue, and troubled with the cares of the world, are ſo carefully occupied about the things of this life that they intend not the worke of the miniſterie, ſeeking more their owne profit than that which is Ieſus Chriſts? how many are there that preach Chriſt rather through ſtrife and enuie than of good will, rather in hope of preferment for their paines, than of any deſire to gaine them that heare them vnto Chriſt, rather in any other reſpect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, than in an holly zeale of the glory of our God? Surely many ſuch carnall Goſpellers there be whoſe God is indeede their belly, which like vnto the ſonnes of <hi>Eli</hi> ſo turne aſide af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the loue of their bellies, and of their pleaſures, that either they forget, or elſe care not for the law of their God. But take heede and beware of them: for yee may not walke as they doe.</p>
                  <p>Yea, generally they make their God their belly that either ſerue their bellies when they ſhould ſerue their God, or care more for the feeding of the bellie than for the knowledge of God, or ſo ſerue God as he doth ſerue their bellies. Looke then well amongſt you that none of you be ſuch, as are then a looking to your profits, or pleaſures, or other things of this life when ye ſhould be looking vnto the ſeruice of your God; that none of you be ſuch as care more for the things of this life, than for the knowledge of Gods wil out of his holy word;
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:599:420"/> that none of you be ſuch as meaſure your ſeruice vnto the Lord by his miniſtring vnto you ſuch things as are needfull for the maintenance of this life: for ſuch do make their God their bellie, either caring more for the things of this life than for God, or elſe only ſo caring for God as they are occaſioned by the things of this life. A foule and groſſe Idolatrie to make our bellie our God. And therefore let vs take heede that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we commit ſuch Idolatrie, nor follow the example of ſuch as commit ſuch Idolatrie.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing which the Apoſtle noteth in theſe inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate walkers is, that their glorie is to their ſhame. Whereby the Apoſtle ſignifieth that the vaine glorie and eſtimation which they ſought after amongſt men, neglecting the true glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſt Ieſus, ſhould turne to their confuſion and ſhame. Which branch alſo of the Apoſtles reaſon might well ſerue for a ſufficient reaſon to moue the <hi>Philippians</hi> not to follow the example of theſe, but to follow him, and ſuch as walked ſo as they had him for an enſample. Hence then I obſerue another note of falſe teachers and inordinate walkers, which is, vainely to ſeeke after glorie and eſtimation amongſt men, neglecting the glorie of God, after whoſe example we may not walke, for that their glorie ſhall be turned into ſhame.<note place="margin">

And therfore it is ſaid of certaine chiefe rulers that in a generalitie beleeued in Chriſt becauſe of the miracles which he did, but not indeede truely beleeue, that they did not confeſſe Chriſt. And the reaſon is added, <hi>for they loued the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God.</hi>

Who is it that is araied with purple and skarlet, and guilded with gold and precious ſtones, and pearles, and hath a cup of gold in her hand full of abominations, and filthineſſe of her fornication where with ſhe make all the Nations of the earth drunke?

                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.42.43</note> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>that they beleeued in Chriſt,</hi> which was true only in a generalitie, but they did not confeſſe him. And the reaſon is added, <hi>For they loued the praiſe of men, more then the praiſe of God.</hi> Thus then we ſee that generally we ſhould in all things ſeeke the glorie of God, and not vaine praiſe and glory amongſt men. So that the ambitious and vaine ſeeking after honour and glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, neglecting the glory of God, is a plaine note in all ſorts of men of inordinate walking.</p>
                  <p>Now to deſcend from the generalitie vnto ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie, did not this note amongſt others plainely deſcrie thoſe falſe Teachers which in <hi>Pauls</hi> abſence ſeduced and bewitched thoſe Churches which he had planted in the faith of Chriſt Ieſus, to be falſe Teachers? Their debaſing and diſgracing of <hi>Paul</hi> in his abſence, their curious affectation of eloquence, wiſedome, knowledge, and learning, as if they had all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and all knowledge, and <hi>Paul</hi> none at all, their vaine oſtentation that they had been conuerſant with the Apoſtles, and that they followed their footſteps, ſaying that <hi>Paul</hi> had not ſeene Chriſt in the fleſh, nor had conuerſed with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, their ambitious deſire to pleaſe the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to creepe

Which albeit the Apoſtle do not in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed termes vtter, yet ſeemeth he vnto me to implie ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>That he ſo ſpake not as they that pleaſe men, but as God which trieth the hearts.</hi> For in both theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I take it is ſignified that they that preach in the intiſing ſpeech of mans wiſedome, they that ſpeake to pleaſe men to be praiſed and had in honour of them, thereby bewray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be falſe Teachers. And it is a iuſt thing with God that they which ſeeke the praiſe of men, and not of God, haue their praiſe with men, but not with God, and that with God their glory bee turned into their owne confuſion and ſhame, if not in this day in their owne conſcience, yet in that day when all faces ſhall gather blackneſſe before him. For then they ſhall ſee that all glory and honour is due vnto him, that all true glory commeth from him, and then ſhall they be aſhamed that they ſought not the honour that commeth of him alone, and their ſhame ſhall be their euerlaſting woe and confuſion.</p>

                  <p>Now I wiſh that this poyſon had crept no farther into the Church, and that they were the men alone that ſeeke the praiſe of men, and not of God. But are there not ſome others that are tainted with this vice of vaine-glory?

For the Goſpell is not deliuered vnto vs that we ſhould thereby ſeeke our owne praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or that the people ſhould honour and magnifie vs which are the Miniſters thereof, but to the end that the benefit and the glory of Chriſt might bee preached and publiſhed, and that the Father might be glorified for his mercy offered vnto vs in Chriſt his ſonne, whom he hath giuen vs, and together with him all things alſo. To conclude therefore this point in one word, we are all of vs that are Chriſtians both Paſtor and people in all things to ſeeke the glory of God, and not of men. For if we doe otherwiſe, and ſeeke the glory of men

See then whether that which hath beene ſaid ſhew not plainely that they are the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, that their God is their belly, that they ſeeke the praiſe of men more then of God.

                  <p>Yet if our practiſe be lookt into it will be found that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we follow them, and none elſe.

For therefore wee haue them that therewith we may doe good vnto all, but eſpecially vnto thoſe that are of the houſhold of faith: wealth, that wee may helpe to ſupply the wants of our brethren, honour and might, that we may helpe to lift the poore out of the mire, fauour and friendſhip, that ſo we may be the better able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them that are oppreſſed, all things needfull and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for this life that therewith wee may doe good vnto thoſe that be in neede or neceſſitie, and that thereby we may glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Father which is in heauen.

For ſo it is deliuered in the originall as a reaſon, <hi>for our conuerſation &amp;c:</hi> a reaſon, I ſay, not of that which immediatly went before, but a reaſon of his exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. where it is ſaid, <hi>brethren, be yee followers of mee &amp;c.</hi> yet ſo that the reaſon is drawne from the <hi>antitheſis</hi> of that which went immediatly before. In theſe words then we haue the ſecond reaſon of the Apoſtles former exhortation, drawne from the <hi>antitheſis</hi> of that which immediatly went before. For as in the former reaſon he ſhewed that they were not to follow thoſe falſe teachers which walked otherwiſe then they had him for an enſample, both by their ſtudie, and by their end, which was damnation; ſo now he ſheweth that they are to follow him, and ſuch others as walke ſo as they haue him for an enſample, both by the cleane contrary courſe of ſtudie, which he, and ſuch as he is follow, and by the contrary end, which is glorification. This then is the manner of the Apoſtles proceeding: His exhortation is, <hi>brethren, be yee followers of me &amp;c.</hi> His reaſon is; for our conuerſation, or our Citie whereof we are citizens, is in heauen, not in earth that we ſhould minde earthly things, or make our God our belly; but in heauen, from whence alſo we looke for the Sauiour, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom we looke for another reward of our walking, then that which the wicked haue, euen the glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:599:426"/> of our vile bodies by that his powerfull working where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able to ſubdue &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In this reaſon then I note theſe three principall points ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues in a threefold profeſſion which the Apoſtle maketh in the behalfe of himſelfe, and ſuch others as walked as he did. The firſt is a Chriſtian profeſſion of their preſent conuerſation in theſe words, <hi>for our conuerſation &amp;c.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is a Chriſtian profeſſion of their expectation of Chriſts ſecond comming to ſaue them, in theſe words, <hi>from whence alſo &amp;c.</hi> The third is a Chriſtian profeſſion of their certaine hope of the glorification of their vile bodies by the powerfull working of Chriſt, in theſe words, <hi>who ſhall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp;c.</hi> Now touching their preſent conuerſation, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle maketh this Chriſtian profeſſion, our conuerſation is in heauen: which is as if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid, It is not ſo with vs as with thoſe falſe teachers newly mentioned: For they as men of this world minde earthly things, and ſet their delight and affections thereon: but we carry and behaue our ſelues in this life as citizens of the heauenly Ieruſalem, ſetting our affections on the things which are aboue. For ſo the words in the originall are as if we ſhould thus read;<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> our Citie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are citizens, and whereunto we haue right, is in heauen. So that his meaning is, that they carry and behaue themſelues, and ſo conuerſe here in this life as citizens of the heauenly Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, minding that, and the things which beſeeme that. Touching the ſecond point, namely their expectation of Chriſt his ſecond comming to ſaue them, the Apoſtle maketh Chriſtian profeſſion, when he ſaith, <hi>from whence </hi> which is as if our Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid; a reaſon why our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation is in heauen is, becauſe from heauen we certainely looke and waite for the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, when he ſhall come as a ſwift iudge againſt all them that haue made their belly their God, but as our Sauiour to giue vs an inheritance among them that are ſaued. In the laſt verſe the Apoſtle maketh a Chriſtian profeſſion of their certaine hope of their glorification, whereof more particularly hereafter. Now let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence for our owne vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <pb n="832" facs="tcp:599:427"/>
                  <p>The firſt thing which I note is the Apoſtles chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion which he maketh in the behalfe of himſelfe, and ſuch others as walked ſo as he did touching their preſent life and conuerſation, which is, that they caried and behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in this life as citizens of heauen, ſetting their affections on the things which are aboue. Whereof the Apoſtle maketh profeſſion to this end, that hereby the <hi>Philippians</hi> might be in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced to follow him, and ſuch as he was, that ſeeing their conuerſation to be ſuch and ſo holy in compariſon of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might make their choice of following them, and haue their conuerſation ſuch as they heard and law that theirs was. Hence then I obſerue what the life and conuerſation of God children ought to be in this vale of miſery, and valley of teares: we ſhould carry and behaue our ſelues here as pilgrims here on earth, and hauing our Citie in heauen, as citizens of the heauenly Ieruſalem, fixing our faith, hope, and loue there, ſetling our thoughts, deſires, and affections there, hauing our hearts, mindes, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And why ſhould it ſeeme ſtrange vnto any, that euen while we liue here in the bodie we ſhould haue our conuerſation in the heauens? Where ſhould the bodie liue but where the head liueth? If then Chriſt which is our head and our life be in heauen, we alſo which are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie ſhould haue our life in heauen where Chriſt which is our life is? Againe, where ſhould the ſpouſe loue and like to be, but where her welbeloued bridegroome is? Her heart and her ſoule ſhould be ſo knit vnto him, as that where he is there ſhould ſhee be alſo.

                  <p>In bodie it muſt needs be that we walke on earth amongſt the ſonnes of men till our earthly houſe of this tabernacle be deſtroyed, and we be clothed with our houſe from heauen. But <hi>here we haue no abiding Citie:</hi>

Nay what elſe is here but a vale of miſery, and a valley of teares? How are we here aſſaulted on euery ſide with the world, the fleſh, and the Deuill? How doe the wicked and vngodly of the earth take ſecret counſell together againſt vs, ſaying, come let vs roote them out that they be no more a people, and that their name may be no more had in remembrance? How doe the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life ſwarme like graſhoppers vpon the face of the earth? How manifold are our neceſſities, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, miſeries, diſtreſſes, perils, croſſes, troubles, tentations, afflictions, loſſes, griefes, and anguiſhes both in ſoule and in bodie while we are in the bodie?

                     <hi>and to dwell with the Lord.</hi> Seeing then that here we are but pilgrims
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:599:428"/> and ſtrangers, and haue no abiding Citie; being that here is but a vale of miſery, and a valley of teares, we are not here to pitch the reſting place of our ſoules, but liuing here in the bodie we are in heart and ſole, in minde and affection to haue our conuerſation in heauen. And that ſo much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>man that is borne of woman is but of ſhort continuance here on earth,</hi>

For thus it is that though our outward man be troubled, yet our inward man is comforted; though in bodie we be afflicted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed on euery ſide, yet in our ſoules we haue peace and ioy of the Holy Ghoſt, euen becauſe our conuerſation is in heauen, whence it is that we looke not on the things which are ſeene, but on the things which are not ſeene. This point might be farther inlarged. But by this it doth appeare that the children of God ought in this life to haue their conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heauen, walking as citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God. Will yee then ſee for your farther vſe and inſtruction what manner perſons yee ought to be in holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation and godlineſſe, that liuing in the bodie yee may be ſaid to walke as citizens of the heauenly Ieruſalem, and to haue your conuerſation in heauen?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we will walke in this life as citizens of the heauenly Ieruſalem, and approue our ſelues to haue our conuerſation in heauen, we may not warre after the fleſh, or ſuffer our ſelues to be intangled with the affaires of this life. For theſe two, to minde earthly things, and to haue the conuerſation in heauen, are, as we ſee in this place, ſo oppoſed the one vnto the other, that the one is a plaine note of inordinate walkers, and the other a ſure token of our adoption into the ſonnes of God to be partakers of the inheritance among the Saints.

For if when he ſets it downe as a law, that we flie that which is euill, and doe that which is good &amp;c, we contrariwiſe flie that which is good, and follow that which is euill; we are no more citizens, but plaine rebels; we haue no conuerſation in heauen, but we plainely fight againſt heauen, and againſt God.

For thus though we be abſent in body from the Lord, yet euen whiles we are in the body, we are and dwell with the Lord.

O but here will the good ſoule ſay, I meane the troubled and afflicted ſoule: True indeed, I might be comforted if I found it thus with me: but thus it is with me; though I haue not wholly minded earthly things, yet haue I minded them more then I ſhould; though I haue withſtood ſuch tentations as haue aſſaulted me, yet in great weakneſſe; though I haue delighted in the law of the Lord, yet haue I often turned out of the way of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; though I haue affected the things which are aboue, yet haue mine affections beene too much diuided betweene the things which are aboue, and the things which are on earth. Well, let not thy ſoule be troubled nor feare. Doeſt thou ſee, and know, and acknowledge thus much? <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he confeſſed his ſinne vnto the Lord,</hi>

Againe, feeleſt thou ſome ſeedes, ſome beginnings of theſe things in thee? Who is it that hath ſowen, and begun theſe things in thee? Euen that God that hath ſaid, <hi>I will not faile thee nor forſake thee,</hi> and therefore will performe that good worke which hee hath begun in thee vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt, and will cauſe thoſe holy ſeedes to bring forth their fruit in due ſeaſon.

We regarded not to ſubmit our ſelues to the lawes of God to be gouerned by them, and therefore wee ſhrinke at death for feare of a iudgement. We neuer aſcended into heauen in our hearts or ſoules, wee neuer raiſed our thoughts, our deſires, or our affections ſo high, wee neuer taſted in our ſelues any ſparkle of thoſe ioyes which are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſhewed in the laſt time, and therefore wee long not after heauen, but we rather loue to liue here on earth. Theſe are the things (I ſay) that make vs ſhrinke at death, and loth to die. Let vs then hearken vnto theſe words of exhortation, and let vs haue our conuerſation in heauen. If we ſhall, then ſhall death be welcome vnto vs, and wee ſhall accept it as the end of our pilgrimage, and as the way to our abiding Citie <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which is aboue, and vnto Chriſt which is our life. For the more we aſcend while we are in the body, in our ſoules and ſpirits, in our meditations and deſires, in faith and hope into heauen, the more will wee deſire to remoue out of the body, that we may for euer dwell with the Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will the more cheerefully open vnto death when hee knockes at our doores.

Hence then I obſerue a ground of that point of an article of our faith, wherein we beleeue that Chriſt ſhall come from heauen with glory to iudge both the quicke and the dead. Whereunto alſo the Scriptures giue witneſſe often elſewhere; as where the Angels told the Apoſtles, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11.</note> 
                     <hi>This Ieſus which is taken vp from you into heauen, ſhall ſo come as yee haue ſeene him goe into heauen:</hi> and againe, where the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the Lord ſhall deſcend from heauen with a ſhout,</hi>

It is a thing which wee all beleeue and confeſſe, that Chriſt being aſcended into heauen where he ſitteth at the right hand of the throne of God, ſhall come againe from heauen in his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time with power and great glory, ſo that euery eye ſhall ſee him, yea euen they which pierced him thorow, and ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto euery man according to that he hath done, whether it be good or euill. The vſes which we are to make hereof are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to beware of ſuch falſe teachers as tell vs that the body
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:599:433"/> of Chriſt is not only in heauen, but in earth alſo, in euery Kingdome, in euery City, in euery pariſh, in euery loafe, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> receiued. For doe wee looke that he ſhall come from heauen the ſecond time with power and great glorie? And ſhall we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not thinke that now he is there whence then hee ſhall come? True it is that Chriſt as hee is God is not in heauen alone, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> limited vnto any place, but filleth all places, being infinite and incomprehenſible. But as he is man, ſo is he there alone whence hee ſhall appeare the ſecond time vnto ſaluation: for ſo it is written,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21.</note> that the heauens muſt containe him vntill the time that all things bee reſtored. And wat elſe is it but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the nature of a true body, to ſay that it may bee in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places at one time? Let this for this time ſuffice vs: Wee looke for Chriſt as he is man from heauen, therefore as hee is man he is in heauen: the heauen muſt containe him till all things be reſtored, therefore he is alone in heauen: hee hath a true body, therefore hee cannot be in diuers places at once. Beware therefore of ſuch deceiuers, that yee giue no place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their errour, and truſt perfectly that Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of the throne of the maieſtie in heauen, hauing no corporall preſence elſewhere, and that from thence hee ſhall come to render vengeance vnto the wicked, and to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach vs to beware of ſuch mockers as walke after their luſts, and ſay, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?</hi> The holy Ghoſt hath ſaid it, that <hi>he ſhall come from heauen the ſecond time with power and great glory.</hi> And hath hee ſaid it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7.</note> and ſhall it not come to paſſe? <hi>It is not for vs to know the times and the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his owne power.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.36</note> Nay Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Of that day and houre when he ſhall come know th no man, no not the Angels in heauen, but God only.</hi> Nay Chriſt himſelfe as he is man knoweth it not.

                     <hi>he would ſurely watch for that time,</hi> but would be very ſecure for other times. It is enough therefore for vs to know that he ſhall
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:599:433"/> come. And this, that we know that he ſhall come, but know not the time when, ſhould exerciſe our faith and patience, bridle our curioſitie, and containe vs in the feare of God, in godlineſſe, and in all watchfulneſſe at all times, leſt hee come vpon vs at vnwares, and finde vs without oile in our lampes, either beating our fellow-ſeruants, or eating and drinking with the drunken, or running after noiſome luſts, and the fooliſh cares of this life. The Lord is not ſlacke concerning his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as ſome men count ſlackneſſe, but is patient towards vs,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37</note> and would haue all men to come to repentance. <hi>Yet a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarrie.</hi> Beware therefore of ſuch mockers as in ſcorne and deriſion ſay, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his comming?</hi> Watch yee and pray continually, that yee may be counted worthy to eſcape all the things that ſhall come to paſſe vpon ſuch moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and that ye may ſtand before the ſonne of man.</p>
                  <p>The third vſe which we are to make hereof, and whereat our Apoſtle eſpecially aimeth, is, that hence we ſhould learne to haue our conuerſation in heauen. For doe wee looke that the Sauiour ſhall come the ſecond time from heauen? Great reaſon then that wee ſhould haue our conuerſation in heauen, that in heart, minde, and ſoule, wee ſhould aſcend thither, that our faith, hope, and loue ſhould be rooted there, that our thoughts, deſires, and affections ſhould be ſettled there. Had <hi>Daniel</hi> reaſon to open his windowes towards <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10.</note> and to pray towards it three times a day, becauſe of Gods promiſe vnto his people when they ſhould pray toward that Temple? And is there not farre greater reaſon for vs that wee ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lift vp our hearts vnto the Lord, and haue our ſoule-conuerſation in heauen, from whence wee doe looke for our bleſſed Sauiour? The children of light herein may learne a leſſon of the children of this world, and of the children of darkneſſe: for where is the merchants minde but where his goods are, and where he hopes for commoditie? where is the husbandmans heart but on his harueſt, and where hee lookes for the fruit of his labours? Where are the affections of the voluptuous or ambitious man ſet, but where the things are which their ſoule moſt deſireth? Where elſe then ſhould the

                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6 21.</note> 
                     <hi>For,</hi> as our Sauiour tells vs, <hi>where our treaſure is, there will our hearts be alſo.</hi> There Chriſt is, thence we looke for the Sauiour, therefore euen while wee are at home in the body, let vs haue our ſoule-conuerſation there in heauen where he dwelleth, and whence wee looke for him.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note is in the perſon of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and others like vnto himſelfe. For here ye ſee that the Apoſtle in behalfe of himſelfe, and ſuch others as walked ſo as he did profeſſeth that they looked for the Sauiour, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which their expectation plainly argued the feruent deſire, and earneſt longing which they had for the appearing of Chriſt the ſecond time vnto ſaluation. Whence I obſerue the gladſome expectation of the faithfull children of God for the ſecond comming of Chriſt, when hee ſhall come in the cloudes of heauen to iudge both the quicke and the dead. They looke and waite for it, their ſoules long after it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19.</note> and with lift vp hearts and voices they crie, and ſay, <hi>How long Lord holy, and true, come Lord Ieſus, come quickly.</hi> It is ſaid in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> that the feruent deſire of the creature waiteth when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed. The word ſignifieth an earneſt waiting of the creature, ſuch as is the waiting of them that are ſet in a watch-tower to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrie, when the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed; i. when it ſhall be manifeſtly knowne, not onely vnto themſelues by faith, but vnto men and Angels that they are the ſonnes of God.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2.</note> For, as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Now we are the ſonnes of God, but yet it doth not appeare what we ſhall be; and we know that when hee ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him: for we ſhall ſee him as he is. And,</hi> as our Apoſtle ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.3.</note> 
                     <hi>when Chriſt which is our life appeareth
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:599:434"/> then ſhall we alſo appeare with him in glory.</hi> For then ſhall hee change our vile body that it may be faſhioned like vnto his glorious body. So that the time for which the creature wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth is the ſecond comming of Chriſt. Doth then the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, euen the heauen and the earth which God created in the beginning waite with ſuch a feruent deſire that they ſit as it were in a watch-tower continually beholding when Chriſt ſhall appeare the ſecond time vnto ſaluation? How great then and gladſome may we imagine the expectation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children of God to be for the ſecond comming of Chriſt, when they ſhall not onely be renued, as the creature, but haue a full complement of euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe? And therefore the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>and not onely the creature, but we alſo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.</note> 
                     <hi>yea we much more which haue receiued the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, euen we doe ſigh in our ſelues waiting for the adoption, euen the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our body;</hi> i. waiting for the conſummation of our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and redemption, when we ſhall fully poſſeſſe our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Saints in heauen. This the Apoſtle commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that they waited for the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10</note> And likewiſe in the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that they looked for the ſonne of the liuing and true God from heauen. And this is a thing which ſhould be commended in vs all.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.13.</note>

It was ioyful no doubt to ſee him come in the fleſh; but ſhall it not be much more ioyfull to ſee him come in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? It was ioyfull to the ſhepheards, and to the wiſe-men of the Eaſt to ſee the babe with <hi>Mary</hi> his mother, and <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> but ſhall it not be much more ioyfull to ſee him attended vpon with tenne thouſands of Saints and Angels?

This is the expectation of the faithfull, which maketh them to looke and long for the bleſſed appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And now ſee the reaſon why the faithfull looke and long for the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now they are pilgrimes, then they ſhall come to an abiding citie:
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:599:435"/> now they are compaſſed with ſorrowes, then ſhall all teares be wiped from their eies: now they are in continuall fight, then ſhall euery enemie be ſubdued vnto them: now they are abſent in body from Chriſt, then ſhall they follow the Lambe whetherſoeuer he goeth: now they know, and loue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in part, then that which is in part ſhall be aboliſhed: now they walke by faith, then ſhall they walke before the throne, and before the Lambe for euermore: then ſhall be the day of their glorification, the day of their redemption, the day of their ſaluation, the day of their abſolute conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all bleſſednes. This is the cauſe why their mindes are euer running, their thoughts euer muſing, their eies euer look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their ſoules euer longing after the ſecond comming of Chriſt Ieſus in glorie. And for this cauſe they euen reach af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, crying with the ſoules vnder the altar, <hi>How long Lord, holy, and true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as for the wicked and vngodly of the earth it is not ſo with them. They doe feare and tremble at the remembrance of it. If they do but heare of it their countenance is changed, their thoughts are troubled, ſo that the ioynts of their loynes are looſed, and their knees ſmite one againſt another, as wee read of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi>

                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6.</note> when he ſaw the palme of the hand that wrote vpon the wall. Yea ſo farre are they from looking and longing after that day, that either they wiſh it might not be at all, or elſe that it might be deferred. And no maruell. For then ſhall the Lord come as a ſwift iudge againſt them, in flaming fire, rendring vengeance vnto them which ſhall bee puniſhed with euerlaſting perdition from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power: then ſhall the wrath of the Lord ſo fiercely perſecute them that they ſhall crie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mountaines and rockes, fall on vs, and hide vs from the preſence of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe, for the great day of his wrath is come, and who may ſtand? then ſhall they heare that fearefull ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced againſt them, <hi>depart from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the Deuill and his Angells:</hi> and then ſhall they be caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone where they ſhall be tormented euen day and night for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<pb n="850" facs="tcp:599:436"/> not for 1000. or 100000. yeare, but for euermore. This is the cauſe why they feare and tremble at euery menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that day: and for this cauſe they wiſh they might neuer ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Examine then your ſelues, men and brethren, how yee ſtand affected towards the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt at that day, whether ye looke and long for it, or yee tremble and feare at the mention of it.<note place="margin">

Is the remembrance of it ioyfull vnto you? It is a ſure token vnto you that ye belong vnto Chriſt Ieſus, and it is a notable fruite and effect of your faith and hope in Chriſt Ieſus. It may be that ſome of you looking more vpon your ſelues and your owne ſinnes then vpon Chriſt and the bowels of his mercies, and being more ſharpe and ſeuere toward your ſelues then quick-ſighted to looke toward Chriſt Ieſus, may feele ſome appalling in your ſelues, or at leaſt not that cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in expectation that ſhould be. But let not your harts be troubled nor feare. Ye looke not only vpon your ſinnes, or ſo on Chriſt as only a ſeuere iudge, and ſo deſpaire in your ſelues, and vtterly abhorre his comming, but yee looke for him, though not without hope, yet without that cheerefulnes which ye ought. In this weakneſſe the Lord will perfit his praiſe, and vnto theſe beginnings hee will giue a good iſſue. Only let my counſell be acceptable vnto you: turne away your eies from your ſelues, and caſt them vpon Chriſt Ieſus. He ſhall be your iudge that is your Sauiour.

                  <p>The third and laſt thing which heere I note, is in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him whom the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>that they looke for from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which is the Lord Ieſus Chriſt the Sauiour.</hi> Wherein I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb n="851" facs="tcp:599:436"/> a reaſon both why wee ſhould walke in this like as citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the heauenly Ieruſalem, hauing our conuerſation in heauen, and why wee ſhould looke and long for the ſecond comming vnto iudgement. For why ſhould it ſeeme ſtrange vnto any man that liuing here in the body wee ſhould haue our ſoule-conuerſation in heauen? Is not our Lord and King mightie in power to ſaue and defend vs, and to reuenge vs of our enemies in heauen? Is not our Ieſus, who not by the workes of righteouſneſſe which we had done, but according to his mercie hath ſaued vs by the waſhing of the new birth, and the renuing of the holy Ghoſt, in heauen? Is not our Chriſt the Mediator of the new Teſtament, that hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vs vnto God, maketh continuall interceſſion for vs, and teacheth vs outwardly by his word, and inwardly by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in heauen? Is not our Sauiour who in that day ſhall make vp the full complement of our ſaluation, in heauen? where then ſhould our conuerſation be but in heauen? where ſhould the body be, but where the head is? where ſhould the ſpouſe be, but where the bridegroome is? not one of vs all but we are ſtung with fierie Serpents, curſed ſinnes, and noyſome luſts which fight againſt the ſoule. If wee will be healed and liue we muſt looke vp vnto the braſen Serpent lift vp for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In heauen is our braſen Serpent euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. We muſt therefore while we are in the body lift vp our eies vnto him, and haue our ſoule-conuerſation in heauen, if now we will be healed of our infirmities, and if when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue out of the body we will dwell with the Lord. And as this ſhould bee a ſufficient reaſon to moue vs to haue our whole conuerſation in heauen, ſo ſhould it alſo moue vs to looke and long for the ſecond comming vnto iudgement.

                  <p>The generall point then here ſpoken is the glorification of our vile bodies in the day of Chriſt by the power of Chriſt.

What he ſhall glorifie in vs, namely our bodies whoſe ſoule-conuerſation hath beene in heauen. 3. the condition of our bodies what now they are, namely bodies of vileneſſe, baſeneſſe, and abiectneſſe, i. Vile, baſe, and abiect bodies, ſubiect to corruption, ſinne, and all kinde of vanitie. 4. The time when he ſhall glorifie our vile bodies, namely in that day when he ſhall come in the cloudes of heauen to iudge both the quick and the dead, which I note out of this that he ſaith, <hi>who ſhall change,</hi> to wit in that day when he ſhall come from whence they looke for him. 5. The manner how he ſhall then glorifie our vile bodies, namely not by changing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note is, the time when Chriſt ſhall change our vile bodies, and make them like vnto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body. The time is in that day when the faithfull looke that he ſhall come in the clouds of heauen to iudge both the quicke and the dead. Which I gather from this that he faith, <hi>who ſhall change &amp;c,</hi> ioyned with that he had ſaid before, <hi>from whence alſo we looke &amp;c.</hi> For the meaning is, that from heauen they looke for the ſecond comming of Chriſt, who then in his ſecond comming ſhall change &amp;c. The obſeruation then hence is, that in the laſt day, when Chriſt ſhall come in the clouds of heauen to iudge the quicke and the dead, then ſhall he raiſe vp the bodies of them that haue ſlept in the duſt, and glorifie them with his owne ſelfe. Which point of the time of our ſecond reſurrection, and glorification of our bodies, the Holy Ghoſt often preciſely noteth: as where it is ſaid, <hi>The houre ſhall come in the which all that are in the graues ſhall heare his voice &amp;c:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.28.6.54.</note> and againe, where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Co.</hi> 15.23.51.52.</note> and againe, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that they that are of Chriſt, at his comming ſhall riſe againe:</hi> and againe where he ſaith, <hi>we ſhall not all ſleepe, but we ſhall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye at the laſt trumpet.</hi> All which places plainely ſhew the time of the reſurrection, and of the glorification of our bodies to be in the laſt day at the ſecond comming of Chriſt vnto iudgment. In the meane time they ſhall ſleepe in the duſt, and make their beds in the graue,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 17.14.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſhall ſay to corruption, thou art my father, and to the worme, thou art my mother, and my ſister.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſhould teach vs patiently with the faithfull children of God to waite and looke for the ſecond comming of Chriſt Ieſus, yea euen to long and reach after it, becauſe then theſe crackt and fraile veſſels ſhall be in better caſe then now they be. Now they are vile, and rotten, and naught, but then ſhall they be changed &amp; made like vnto Chriſt his glorious body;
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:599:439"/> and then ſhall they be vnited to the ſoules to receiue that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inheritance which God the Father of old hath prepared, God the Sonne of late hath purchaſed, and God the Holy Ghoſt doth daily ſeale in the hearts of Gods children. That is the time for our full deliuerance, our full redemption when al things ſhall be ſubdued vnder him. And till that time after that death once deſtroy theſe bodies, the graue ſhall be our houſe, and we ſhall make our bed in the darke.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which here I note is, what it is that Chriſt in that day ſhall raiſe vp againe, and glorifie, namely our vile body. Whence my firſt obſeruation is, that ſince ſinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, and death by ſinne, ſuch is the condition of our bodies here that they be vile, ſubiect to all infirmities, miſeries, mortalitie, corruption, and all kinde of vanity. The experience whereof is ſo common, and ſo well knowne vnto vs all, that it ſhall not be needfull to proue it vnto any of vs How many aches, infirmities, diſeaſes are we troubled withall in our bodies? What wounds, and ſwellings, and ſores full of all manner of corruption are our bodies ſubiect vnto? What labours, what perils, what watchings, faſtings, cold, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, impriſonments, how many kinds of death are they ſubiect vnto? How ſoone are they cut downe like graſſe? How ſoone doe they wither as the greene herbe? How ſoone doe they returne vnto the duſt whence they firſt came? Or what priuiledge here haue the bodies of them that come of noble houſes, of honourable parents, of the bloud royall? None at all, but their bodies are as vile, as here the Apoſtle meaneth, as ſubiect to diſeaſes, as needing all helps for health, is vnable to endure labour, heat, cold, hunger, thirſt, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to want ſleepe, reſt, foode, apparell, as ſoone cut downe by the hand of death, as ſoone deuoured by the wormes, as ſoone turned vnto the duſt as the bodies of other men. And therefore our bodies without exception in the holy ſcriptures are called and likened vnto graſſe, the flower of the field, to earthen veſſels, to earthly houſes, to tabernacles, to duſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>athe, &amp;c. <hi>All fleſh is as graſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24.</note> 
                     <hi>and all the glory of man is as the flower of graſſe: the graſſe withereth, and the flower falleth away.</hi> Yea looke what <hi>Iobs</hi> bodie was that all our bodies are,
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:599:440"/> if the Lord ſhall lay his hands vpon them: Yea this ſhall be the ſtate of our bodies to be thus vile, as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, till they bee changed, and made like vnto his glorious body.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould teach vs to plucke downe our ſailes, and to abate the great daintineſſe of our bodies whereunto we are growne. Such ſilks and veluets, ſuch ruffes and lawnes, ſuch frizling and painting, ſuch chaines, bracelets, and rings, as now commonly we vſe, what elſe is it, but to cloth and adorne proud rottenneſſe? Such choice of meats, daintineſſe of fare, variety of diſhes, as in this heauy time of dearth and famine is ſome where vſed, what elſe is it but to feede the neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied belly? Nay are not ſome growne ſo nice that they may not ſuffer the winde to blow vpon them, nor the ſunne to ſhine vpon them? Is it not for ſome ſo hot in ſummer, and againe ſo cold in winter, that they can finde no time to come to heare euen the holy word of God? And what elſe is it that we doe thus cheriſh but a vile body, ſubiect to all kinde of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? The beginning whereof what is it but earth? the being whereof what is it but as from the earth? the end whereof what is it but to the earth? And yet what curioſitie in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and what daintineſſe in feeding this vile body? An al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance there is, and meete there ſhould be, that according to each mans degree there be both coſtlineſſe in clothing, and daintineſſe in feeding. But in each degree there is ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of decencie, as that it may be thought that no degree conſidereth what a vile body it is that they cheriſh. How much better were it that we ſhould conſider our ſelues, and that we ſhould moderate our ſelues in theſe things each man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his degree? Let vs therefore whether we eat, or drinke, or cloth our ſelues, remember that the bodies which we cheriſh are but vile bodies, duſt and aſhes, euen very rottenneſſe, and ſubiect to all kinde of vanity.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond obſeruation hence is, that Chriſt in the laſt day ſhall change our bodies not our ſoules, and raiſe vp our bodies not our ſoules. For our ſoules in their very deliuerance from the contagion of our bodies are purged and cleanſed from euery ſpot of ſinne, and immediatly tranſlated into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:599:440"/> and there abide till the laſt iudgement. They die not, nor ſleepe, nor wander vp and downe, as ſome doe fooliſhly imagine, but being ſpirituall ſubſtances they liue and abide for euer, aſwell out of the body, as in the body. Which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as by the ſoules of the rich man and <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.23.</note> the one of which had immediatly ioy in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, the other ſuffered woe and torments in hell immediatly; ſo doth it alſo appeare by that viſion of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.9.</note> where he ſaw the ſoules vnder the Altar &amp;c: for there the preſent ſtate wherein they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their departure out of their bodies vntill the laſt iudgment is deſcribed, namely that they are vnder the Altar, .i. that they remaine continually vnder the hand of our Lord Ieſus, and that they be in ioyfull reſt vnder his cuſtody and protection. Our ſoules then are not changed or raiſed vp in the laſt day, but our bodies; euen as we make confeſſion in our Creede, when we beleeue the reſurrection of the body: For therein we confeſſe that we beleeue that in that day when the Lord ſhall deſcend from heauen with a ſhoute, and with the voice of the Archangell, and with the trumpet of God, he ſhall raiſe againe theſe ſelfe-ſame bodies out of the duſt of death, and vnite them vnto our ſoules, that in ſoule and body wee may liue for euer with him in heauen in the perfect ſtate of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Yea but doth not the Preacher ſay,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.19.</note> that the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beaſts are euen as one condition vnto them? If then there be no reſurrection of the bodies of beaſts after this life, how doe we ſay that there is any reſurrection of the bodies of men? The meaning of the Preacher is, that man is not able by reaſon and iudgment to put a difference betweene the dying of man and beaſt, as by his eye to iudge otherwiſe of a man being dead, then of a beaſt being dead. But neither he there ſpeakes of mans eſtate after death, neither what we know by the word of God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of man and of beaſt. For thence we know that the ſpirit of man aſcendeth vpward when it leaueth the body, and that the ſpirit of the beaſt deſcendeth downeward to the earth; and that the body of the beaſt ſleepeth for euer in the duſt, but the body of man ſhall be raiſed vp at the laſt
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:599:441"/> day vnto life euerlaſting in the heauens How then doth the Apoſtle ſay,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Co.</hi> 15.10.</note> that <hi>fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of God?</hi> There the meaning of the Apoſtle is, that the naturall body as it is now ſubiect to ſinne and corruption cannot inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome of God, vntill it be glorified, foraſmuch as none vncleane thing entreth into it. This therefore is it that we teach, Chriſt ſhall raiſe vp our vile bodies in the laſt day, and make them like vnto his glorious body, and ſo poſſeſſe vs in ſoule and body of that kingdome prepared for vs from before all beginnings.</p>
                  <p>Here then is a notable comfort for all Gods children, that not onely our ſoules after this life ended ſhall goe vnto God that gaue them, but our bodies likewiſe in the laſt day ſhall be raiſed vp againe, and be made like vnto Chriſt his glorious body, that our ſoules and bodies being vnited together wee may liue for euer with him in his kingdome of glory. For hereupon thus we may reſolue with our ſelues: What though I be afflicted and tormented? What though my miſeries be as many and grieuous as <hi>Iobs</hi> were? What though I bee racked, torne in peeces with wilde horſes, my body caſt to the birds of the aire, to the beaſt of the land, or to the fiſhes in the ſea? I know that after this life ended there will follow a ioyfull reſurrection. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> comforted himſelfe amidſt all his extremities,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 19.25.26.27.</note> ſaying, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liueth, and that he ſhall ſtand the laſt on the earth; and though after my skin wormes deſtroy this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh, whom I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and none other for me, though my reines be conſumed within me.</hi> And ſo we read that the Saints of God mentioned to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> comforted themſelus:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35.</note> For when they were racked and tormented they would not be deliuered: and why? becauſe they looked for a better reſurrection. Whatſoeuer therefore trouble, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, aduerſitie, miſery, death doe befall vs or our friends, let vs comfort our ſelues in this that there ſhall be an end of all troubles when all teares ſhall be wiped from our eyes, and that there ſhall be a ioyfull reſurrection in the laſt day, and glorification of our mortall bodies.</p>
                  <p>My third obſeruation hence is, that the reſurrection of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:599:441"/> vnto glorification is only of them whoſe ſoule-conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life is in heauen. For albeit in the reſurrection not only the ſheepe, but the goats, not only they that haue done good, but they that haue done euill ſhall riſe againe with their bodies, yet the one only vnto euerlaſting ioy and glory, the other vnto euerlaſting woe and miſerie. So ſaith <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.29.</note> 
                     <hi>They ſhall come forth that haue done good vnto the reſurrection of life, and they that haue done euill vnto the reſurrection of condemnation.</hi> The ſame alſo is moſt plaine by that ſeparation of the ſheepe from the goats in the laſt day, where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.</note> that the one ſhall ſtand at his right hand, the other at his left; that the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one ſhall be with the Saints of God in heauen, the portion of the other with the deuill and his Angels in hell; that the one ſhall goe into life eternall, the other into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting paine.</p>
                  <p>Whereof we are to make this vſe, that if we will haue our part in the ſecond reſurrection after this life vnto glory, wee muſt alſo haue our part in the firſt reſurrection in this life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grace. In this life wee muſt riſe from the death of ſinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the life of God in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, if in that day wee will riſe from the power of the graue vnto life euerlaſting and bleſſedneſſe in the heauens.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.6.</note> For <hi>bleſſed and holy is he,</hi> yea only <hi>bleſſed and holy is he that hath his part in the firſt reſurrection: for on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power.</hi> Let vs therefore follow the counſell of <hi>Peter,</hi> let vs <hi>amend our liues,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19.</note> 
                     <hi>and turne vnto the Lord, that our ſinnes may be done away when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> Let vs in this life grow vp in grace, that in that day we may riſe vp in glory. Thus much of the third point, <hi>viz.</hi> what Chriſt in that day ſhall raiſe and glorifie.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing which I note, is touching the manner how Chriſt ſhall in that day glorifie our vile bodies, namely by changing not the ſubſtance of our bodies, but by changing our vile bodies and faſhioning them in qualitie like vnto Chriſt his glorious body. Whence I obſerue what ſhall be the glorified bodies of the Saints of God wherein at the hearing of his voice, and the ſound of the trumpet they ſhall riſe in that day. And this it is: Our corruptible bodies ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:599:442"/> vp in incorruption, our mortall bodies ſhall be raiſed vp in immortalitie, our bodies which were vile carcaſes ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp in glory, our bodies which were weake ſhall be raiſed vp in power, our bodies which were naturall, needing foode, raiment, reſt, ſleepe, phyſicke, and the like, ſhall be raiſed vp ſpirituall, needing none of theſe things, but being as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God exempt from all wants and infirmities of this life. Our bodies in ſubſtance, in figure, in lineaments, and in mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhall be the ſelfe-ſame that they were in this life, inaſmuch as in theſe there was no change by the ſinne of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: but in ſuch vile qualities as by ſinne they were poiſoned and infected with, they ſhall ſo be changed as hath beene ſaid. And this is the glorification of our bodies in that day. He that ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, ſhall thus change the vileneſſe of our bodies, and faſhion them like vnto his owne glorious body. Of this glorification <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaketh, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3.</note> that <hi>they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firmament, and they that turne many vnto righteouſneſſe ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres for euer and euer.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.2</note> And a glimpſe of it <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw when Chriſt was transfigured in the mount be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note> And the Apoſtle at large ſhewes the whole manner of it to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then hence wee learne that the body of Chriſt is not ſo deified or glorified, as that the eſſentiall properties of God are communicated to it, as to be omnipotent, infinite, preſent euery where, &amp;c. For this being true, that our bodies ſhall be made like vnto his glorious body, then our bodies alſo ſhould then be omnipote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, infinite, euery where, &amp;c. which no man will ſay. They erre therefore that maintaine the body of Chriſt to be really preſent euery where.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence we may learne not to be diſmaied at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſickneſſe, danger, or death. It may be that thus our bodies may be turned into the graue, and that death haue there dominion ouer vs for a ſeaſon: but in the laſt day our bodies ſhall be taken out of the power of death, and made like vnto Chriſt his glorious body.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence we may receiue great comfort that we haue ſuch a Sauiour as will thus change our vile bodies, and make
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:599:442"/> them like vnto his glorious body. Hee will be a perfect Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and therefore as he receiues our ſoules at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>and protection, ſo will hee alſo in the laſt day change our vile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>odies, and make them like vnto his glorious body, that ſo he may be a perfect Sauiour both of our ſoules and bodies.</p>
                  <p>The fift and laſt thing which from theſe words I note, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any and notable, and moſt worthy our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall meditation, haue bin the points which we haue heard by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the former Chapter, as touching ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary watchfulneſſe againſt falſe teachers, together with certain marks of ſuch, ver. 2.19; touching the true circumciſion of the Spirit, ver. 3; touching the vanitie of all confidence and reioycing in any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, ver. 4. to 9; touching iuſtification by the alone righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt Ieſus, through faith in his bloud, v. 9; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by ſome ſence of the knowledge of Chriſt, and of the vertue of his reſurrection in our ſelues, &amp;c. and by an holy acknowledgement of imperfection, and purſuite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection, ver. 10. to 15; touching Chriſtian perfection, ver. 15; touching the ſole rule of mans life ver. 16; touching an holy imitation, v. 17; touching euill and vngodly walkers, ver. 18, 19; touching an holy conuerſation, ver 20; touching the expectation of the faithfull for Chriſt his ſecond coming, v. 20; touching the glorification of our vile bodies in the day
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:599:444"/> of Chriſt by the power of Chriſt, ver. 21; ſome of which the Apoſtle purpoſely diſputeth, and others by occaſion he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. For in that Chapter ye may remember that the Apoſtle inſtructeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> touching circumciſion, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching iuſtification, and touching ſanctification, becauſe of the falſe teachers which vrged the circumciſion of the fleſh, and iuſtification by workes, and told them that they knew Chriſt well enough. And therfore, firſt he exhorteth them to beware of ſuch falſe teachers: ſecondly he inſtructeth them in the true circumciſion of the Spirit: thirdly he tels them what he in his owne perſon thought of his owne workes, and of all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges that he had without Chriſt; what he thought of the righteouſnes of Chriſt through faith, what he thought of his knowledge of Chriſt, and how he laboured ſtill after further knowledge of Chriſt, and further perfection then as yet he had attained vnto: fourthly he exhorteth them to be of the ſame mind with him in theſe things, and all to proceed by one rule of the word: fiftly and laſtly he exhorteth them to follow him and ſuch as he is, for that thoſe other deceiuers that were amongſt them, were both enemies to the truth, and had earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minds onely; but he and ſuch as walked as he did, had their conuerſation in heauen, from whence they looked for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhould change their vile bodie, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now the Apoſtle in this Chapter concludeth his Epiſtle with certain exhortations, with ſignification of his ioy in the Lord for their liberalitie ſent vnto him in priſon by their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and with diuers ſalutations to them, and from himſelfe and them that were with him. His exhortations are ſome of them generall, and ſome of them particular, as we ſhall ſee in the handling of the former part of this chapter. His firſt exhortation in the firſt verſe, ye ſee is generall, wherein he exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> in generall vnto perſeuerance in the faith of Chriſt Ieſus, and the practiſe of an holy life, as they haue bene taught, and as hitherto they had done. His ſecond exhortation in the ſecond verſe is particular, wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth two chiefe women amongſt them, as it may ſeeme to vnitie and concord, either betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or betwixt them
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:599:444"/> and the Church at <hi>Philippi.</hi> In the firſt generall exhortation I note, firſt the maner how the Apoſtle comes vnto his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: ſecondly the kind and louing termes wherein he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> before his exhortation: thirdly the exhortation it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Touching the maner how the Apoſtle comes vnto his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, it is by way of concluſion vpon that which before he had ſaid, <hi>Therefore my brethren, &amp;c. ſo continue &amp;c.</hi> And it is as if he had ſaid, Seeing thoſe of the conciſion among you, which vrge circumciſion, and iuſtification by workes, are ſuch euill workers as ye haue heard; and ſeeing our conuerſation is in heauen, from whence we looke for the Sauiour, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall change, &amp;c. therefore continue ye in the Lord ſo as ye haue done, and as I haue now taught you to do by example in mine owne perſon, and ſuffer not your ſelues to be ſeduced by them that are enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe end is, &amp;c. Thus the Apoſtle by way of concluſion from that which he had ſaid before, inferreth this generall exhortation vnto perſeuerance and continuance in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the kinde and louing termes wherein hee ſpeakes vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> ye ſee he calls them his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, beloued, and longed for, his ioy, and his crowne. In that he ſaith vnto them, <hi>My brethren, beloued, and longed for,</hi> he ſheweth his owne kind affection towards them: and in that he addeth, <hi>my ioy and my crowne,</hi> he ſignifieth their pietie, wherein he was comforted. To haue ſaid vnto them onely <hi>my brethren,</hi> as in the beginning of the third Chapter; or only, <hi>my beloued,</hi> as Chap. 2. ver. 12. had betokened abundantly his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards them: but in that, as not content with the one, or both, he addeth alſo a third argument of loue, he thereby plainly ſheweth, what a large roome they had in his heart. He calleth them his brethren in Chriſt, as begotten by one Spirit vnto one God in one faith, through one Goſpell of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. He calleth them his beloued, in the beſt bond of loue, the vnitie of the Spirit, through the embracing of the ſame truth of Chriſt Ieſus. And for that he ſaith, that he <hi>longed</hi> for them, he ſhewed it in 1. Chap. where he ſaith, that he <hi>longed after
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:599:445"/> them all from the very heart roote in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.8.</note> which was no doubt to ſtrengthen them, and to beſtow vpon them ſome ſpirituall comfort, becauſe of thoſe falſe teachers that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them. How could he more ſhew a kind and louing affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards them? And as by theſe he ſhewes his affection towards them, ſo by thoſe titles that follow, he ſhewes again on the other ſide, their great pietie and godlineſſe. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he call them his <hi>ioy,</hi> becauſe of their fellowſhip, as himſelfe ſpeaketh, which they had in the Goſpell with other Churches,<note place="margin">1.5.</note> from the firſt day that they had receiued the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vnto that preſent, which was a ſufficient matter of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing: and therefore doth he call them his <hi>crowne,</hi> becauſe their conſtancie and perſeuerance was now his glorie among other Churches, and ſhould be the crowne of his reioycing in the day of Chriſt. The ſpeech is borrowed from them that for matters well atchieued, in running, wreſtling, or the like, receiue a crowne of glorie. And it argueth their great profite by his labours, for which he ſhould receiue a crowne. Thus ye ſee what theſe kind termes import, and in what ſence the Apoſtle giueth them vnto the <hi>Philippians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing which I noted, was the exhortation it ſelf, which is, to continue in the Lord, <hi>So continue in the Lord, ye beloued.</hi> The words preciſely are, <hi>So ſtand in the Lord:</hi> but the ſence is very truly giuen, when it is ſaid, <hi>So continue in the Lord.</hi> For, to ſtand in grace, in faith, in the Spirit, in the Lord, is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually in the new Teſtament, to continue in grace, in faith, in the Spirit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2.</note> in the Lord. <hi>By Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we haue acceſſe through faith vnto this grace wherein we ſtand,</hi> that is, wherein we continue.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Stand in the faith,</hi> ſaith he in another place, that is, continue in the faith. <hi>Let your conuerſation be,</hi> ſaith he in the firſt chapter of this Epiſtle, <hi>as it becometh the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, that I may heare of your matters, that ye ſtand in one ſpirit,</hi> that is, that ye continue in one ſpirit. And to the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are we aliue if ye ſtand in the Lord,</hi> that is, if ye continue in the Lord. So in this place, <hi>ſo ſtand in the Lord,</hi> that is, ſo continue as they that keepe their ſtanding, without ſhrinking, fainting, ſliding, or ſtarting aſide. For the ſpeech is borrowed from them that ſtand vpon thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="725" facs="tcp:599:445"/> guard or watch, or in their ranke wherein they are ſet. Now wherein would he haue them to ſtand and continue? Namely <hi>in the Lord,</hi> that is, in the knowledge and in the faith of Chriſt Ieſus, rooted and built in him, and ſtabliſhed in the faith. But what meaneth he by this that he ſaith, <hi>So continue in the Lord? So,</hi> that is, as hitherto ye haue done, and as now ye haue bene taught by example in mine owne perſon, renouncing all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the fleſh, counting all mans righteouſneſſe by any workes whatſoeuer, but loſſe and dung, and reioycing onely in Chriſt Ieſus; ſo continue and perſeuere in the Lord, rooted and built in him, and ſtabliſhed in the faith, do this ye belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in the beſt bond of loue. And let this be ſpoken touching the points of this generall exhortation, and the meaning of the words. Now let vs gather hence ſome notes for our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which I note, is from the kind and louing termes wherein the Apoſtle writes vnto the <hi>Philippians.</hi> He exhorts them vnto perſeuerance in the knowledge and faith of Chriſt Ieſus; but in ſuch a tender and louing maner, as that therein he bewrays a moſt kind and louing affection towards them, ſaying, <hi>my brethren, beloued, and longed for, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo in his ſecond exhortation in ver. 2. he <hi>prayeth Euodias, and beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Syntyche;</hi> and likewiſe in his third exhortation in verſ. 3. he <hi>beſeecheth his faithfull yoke-fellow.</hi> Whence I obſerue a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie dutie for the Miniſter of the Goſpell, which is, to be ſo tenderly affected towards his people, as that in all kind and louing maner he labour to win them vnto that which is good, and to weane them from that which is euil. His people ſhould not be kept ſtrait in his bowels, but ſhould haue a large roome in his heart; ſo that whether he write or ſpeake vnto them, it may appeare that it is out of his loue and tender affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Thus our Apoſtle profeſſeth in plaine ſpeech that he was affected towards the Corinthians, where he ſaith, <hi>O Corinthians, our mouth is open vnto you, our heart is made large,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</note> 
                     <hi>ye are not kept ſtrait in vs.</hi> And this affection both our Apoſtle and the reſt of the Apoſtles bewray alwayes in all their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, inſtructing them to whom they wrote, as in the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome word of truth, ſo in all meekneſſe of ſpirit, and mildneſſe
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:599:446"/> of ſpeech,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</note> as from a loue moſt vnfained and Chriſtian. <hi>I beſeech you</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle to the Romanes) <hi>brethren, by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God:</hi>

                     <hi>remember the words which were ſpoken before of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe were their bowels of loue towards their brethren in Chriſt; and in ſuch bowels of loue ſhould the Miniſters of the Goſpell after their example deale with their people, exhorting them and admoniſhing them with all patience &amp; long ſuffering, and in all loue vnto them, leading them forth beſides the waters of comfort, which may ſpring vp in them into euerlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>It may be that here ſome wil ſay, O we ſhould like this wel if the Miniſters of the Goſpell would do thus; but ſome of them are ſo ſharpe, that they ſeeme to forget that they are Miniſters of the Goſpel, at leaſt they remember not this dutie. Why? becauſe they are ſharpe, and come with a rod? Is it an argument againſt the father of the bodie, that he loues not his child, becauſe he ſometimes reproues him, and ſometimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth him with the rod? Or is it no argument againſt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the bodie, and ſhall it be an argument againſt ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as beget you in Chriſt Ieſus through the Goſpell? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, did not thoſe holy Apoſtles that came in ſuch a ſpirit of meekneſſe, as we haue heard, come alſo ſomtimes with a rod? The proofes are ſo pregnant, that I thinke none will doubt of it, as neither of this, that their coming with a rod was in great loue. Againe, did not the ſame God that came to <hi>Eliah</hi> onely in a ſoft and ſtill voice, come vnto <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> in the earthquake, and vnto <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> in the fire? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, are there not in our congregations ſome ſuch as had need to be wounded, as well as ſome ſuch as had need to be healed? And if we loue both, muſt we not bring with vs both oile and vineger? Both ſharpneſſe and meekneſſe in their due places are needfull, and a wiſe diſcretion in them both is moſt needfull; and in both, the wiſe Miniſter ſheweth forth the
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:599:446"/> bowels of his loue. Indeed the termes of loue are different, when we come with a rod, and when we come in the ſpirit of meekneſſe.

And as thus ye ſhould be our ioy, ſo ſhould ye alſo be our crowne. Ye, by your faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and by your loue towards all Saints, and by your growing vp in all things into him which is your head, that is Chriſt, by the worke of our miniſterie, ſhould be our glorie in all places, and the crowne of our reioycing in the day of Chriſt Ieſus.

                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note, is the Apoſtles exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with the reaſon thereof. His exhortation is, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> would ſtand and continue without ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, fainting, ſliding or ſtarting aſide, in the knowledge and faith of Chriſt Ieſus, rooted in him, and ſtabliſhed in the faith, ſo as hitherto they had done, and as now they had bene taught by example in his owne perſon, renouncing all confidence in the fleſh and in things without Chriſt, and reioycing onely in Chriſt Ieſus.

Why then doth the Apoſtle exhort vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Lord, if it be not in our owne power, if we will, being holpen by grace, to continue in the Lord? Which is as if it ſhould be ſaid, If the fruite and increaſe of the earth be wholly the bleſſing of the Lord, then why doth the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man manure and till his ground, and beſtow ſuch paines and trauell therein? Or, as if it ſhould be ſaid, If faith be wholly the gift of God, then why are we ſo called vpon to come and heare the word preached? For as he giueth corne, and wine, and oile, and all things elſe needfull for this life, but yet by ſuch meanes as he hath ordained thereunto; and againe, as faith is the gift of God alone, but yet giuen vs by the meanes of hearing the word preached:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8.</note> ſo the Lord which confirmeth vs vnto the end, worketh in vs this holy gift of perſeuerance and continuing in him, but by ſuch holy admonitions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations as he will haue vſed to that purpoſe. For admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exhortations are not therefore vſed, to imply any power in our ſelues to doe the things we are exhorted vnto, but becauſe they are the meanes whereby God worketh his good graces in vs. And they do and may rather put vs in mind of our vnableneſſe, then of our ableneſſe to do the things that we are exhorted; that ſeeing we cannot of our ſelues will or do the things whereunto we are exhorted, as, to come vnto the Lord, to continue in the Lord, therefore we ſhould flie vnto him, and pray vnto him, that he would draw vs vnto him, that he would confirme vs vnto the end, and that he would frame our wils according to his bleſſed will, that we may by him do what his will is. To continue then in the Lord, is the grace of Gods holy Spirit, and the exhortation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is very needfull, both becauſe it is the meanes whereby the Lord will worke his grace in vs, and to ſet vs vnto the Lord, to beg that of him, which of our ſelues we are no way able to do.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond doubt alſo may be moued: Whether it can be,
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:599:449"/> that ſuch of Gods children as are in the Lord, ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Lord? Whereunto I anſwer, that ſuch of Gods children as are graffed in the true oliue, may for ſome while ſeeme like vnto withered branches, the graces of Gods Spirit may for a time decay in them, and lie ſmothered, ſo that they appeare no more then the fire vnder the aſhes or imbers. So we may ſee in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who hauing committed murder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, walked on a long time, and was neuer touched with any remorſe for ſuch his grieuous ſinnes, ſo that for the time he might ſeeme to be as a withered branch. So we may ſee in <hi>Peter</hi> many eclipſes of the graces of Gods Spirit, when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded Chriſt his paſſion, when he denied Chriſt his maiſter, and that with an oath, when he fled from his Maiſter, when he diſſembled for feare of them of the circumciſion, and drew <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo into the like diſſimulation, &amp;c. So we may ſee in <hi>Demas,</hi> who for a time left <hi>Paul,</hi> and embraced this preſent world, and yet afterwards became again a fellow-helper with <hi>Paul.</hi> In other holy perſons the like may be ſhewed, in whom the graces of God haue for a time decayed, and they bene like to withered branches. But they cannot finally fall from grace, but <hi>he that hath begun a good worke in them,</hi>

Why then doth the Apoſtle exhort vs to continue in the Lord, if it be ſure that we ſhall continue in the Lord? It is to remoue from vs carnall ſecuritie, and to teach vs to depend on the Lord, by whom we continue in his

To conclude this point therefore, as the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> ſo ſay I vnto you, Continue in the Lord, euen in the faith and knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo as ye haue bene taught in Chriſt Ieſus. Let it neuer be ſaid to you, as it was to the Galatians, <hi>Ye did runne well, who did let you, that ye did not obey the truth?</hi> But as ye haue begun to loue and like the truth, ſo continue to walke in the truth, that when Chriſt Ieſus ſhall come in the clouds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ye may be the crowne of our reioycing, and that ye may alſo appeare with him in glorie.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow follow certaine particular exhortations vnto particular and priuate perſons, touching ſome diſcord fallen out amongſt them. In the ſecond verſe his requeſt is vnto <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche,</hi> that they would be of one accord in the Lord. What <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche</hi> were it is not certaine, neither are they mentioned elſewhere in the Scripture. Like it is by this place, that they were two women of good note, and ſuch as had much ſtood with <hi>Paul</hi> at his firſt planting of the Church at <hi>Philippi.</hi> But now it ſeems they were at oddes, whether the one with the other, or both with the reſt of the Church; and whether about matters of faith and religion, or about ordinary matters of common life, it is not certaine. This we ſee, the Apoſtle would gladly compoſe, the ſtrife, and therefore he exhorteth them <hi>to be of one accord in the Lord,</hi> that is, of one mind and one iudgement in the things of the Lord, betwixt themſelues and with the Church. If we vnderſtand that they differed in matters of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:599:450"/> or if we vnderſtand the words in generall, of what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions ſoeuer, then the exhortation is, that laying aſide all debates and diſſenſions, they would be of one accord in the Lord, that is, they would dwell together in ſuch vnitie as is pleaſing to the Lord. <hi>I pray Euodias, and beſeech Syntyche, &amp;c.</hi> It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea, and I beſeech thee, &amp;c.</hi> In this verſe the Apoſtles exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or requeſt is vnto his faithfull yoke-fellow, that he would be a meanes to compoſe the ſtrifes of <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyche,</hi> with this reaſon implied, becauſe they were women which had laboured with him when he preached the Goſpell at <hi>Philippi,</hi> nor with him onely, but with <hi>Clement</hi> alſo, and with diuers others which labored with him in the ſame work, whoſe names are written in the booke of life. What this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yoke-fellow was whom he maketh this requeſt vnto, it is not certaine. Much diſputation there is who it ſhould be. Like it is that it was ſome ſpeciall man that preached the Goſpell purely and ſincerely there with him at <hi>Philippi.</hi> Him he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſteth to helpe thoſe women, namely <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche:</hi> How to helpe them? Namely to order their matters, and to compoſe their ſtrifes whatſoeuer they were. And why ſhould he do ſo? That which the Apoſtle addeth, ſeemeth to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a reaſon to moue his faithful yokefellow to help them, and to compoſe their ſtrifes: <hi>for they laboured with him in the Goſpell,</hi> that is, when the Goſpell was firſt preached by him at <hi>Philippi,</hi> they laboured, yea and euen <hi>ſtroue,</hi> for ſo the word ſignifieth, putting themſelues in hazard for the hearing of the Goſpell preached, and for the defence of the Goſpell. For in the Acts mention is made of women, among whom was <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> that came together to a place beſides the riuer,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 16.13.</note> not daring as it may ſeeme, to haue their aſſemblies in the citie of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> and there heard the word at <hi>Pauls</hi> mouth. Theſe two women, it may ſeeme, were two of them, of whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle for that cauſe ſaith, that they labored and ſtroue with him in the Goſpell, he being willing to preach, and they deſirous to heare, when there was great danger for both, and they ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much in his defence when he was much contradicted. Neither doth he commend them to haue laboured with him
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:599:451"/> alone in the Goſpel, but with <hi>Clement</hi> alſo, and with other his fellow-labourers, which laboured with him in the worke when the Goſpel was firſt preached at <hi>Philippi.</hi> Who this <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was, it is not certaine, as neither who theſe his fellow-labourers were. <hi>Silas,</hi> it is like by that place in the Acts, was one. Miniſters of the Goſpell they were, which ioyned their labours with <hi>Paul,</hi> to the gathering of the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> whoſe names though they were not written by him in this Epiſtle, yet he ſaith, that they were written in the book of life. Whereby he meaneth, that their life was as certainly ſealed vp with God, as if their names had bene written vp in a booke to that purpoſe. For the ſpeech is borrowed from the maner of them that bill the names of them in a booke, whom they haue choſen into their ſeruice, whom then they know to be theirs, becauſe they haue their names billed in a booke. So God knoweth who are his as certainly as if their names were written in a booke, and their life is as ſurely ſealed with him, as if their names were regiſtred to that purpoſe. The ſumme then of the Apoſtles reaſon, is this: theſe women for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with him and other his fellow-labourers in the Goſpel, were worthy that he ſhould do this for them, and therefore he requeſts his faithful yoke-fellow that he would help them, &amp; compoſe the ſtrifes which were either betwixt themſelues, or betwixt them and the Church there. And let this ſuffice to be ſpoken touching the ſcope of theſe particular exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the meaning of the words in them both. Now let vs ſee what notes we may gather hence for our further vſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then in the perſon of <hi>Paul,</hi> I note his holy care, not onely to inſtruct and exhort the whole Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> in generall, but likewiſe priuately ſuch particular perſons as he heard it was needfull to inſtruct and exhort. For here we ſee how after his generall exhortation vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he commeth vnto particular exhortations to priuate perſons, Whence I obſerue a holy dutie of a good Miniſter, which is, not only publikly to teach and exhort, and comfort his whole congregation in the Church, but alſo priuatly to labour with particular perſons ſo as ſhall be needfull for them. If they need inſtruction, to inſtruct them; exhortation, to exhort them
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:599:451"/> conſolation to comfort them; correction, to reproue them; peace-making, to compoſe their ſtrifes; and euery way to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with them as it ſhall appeare to be needfull for them. Examples hereof we haue in generall in all the Apoſtles, of whom it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 5.42.</note> that <hi>they ceaſſed not to teach and preach Ieſus Chriſt dayly in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe.</hi> Ye ſee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not onely <hi>Iohns</hi> generall Epiſtle, but his priuate Epiſtles alſo, one vnto a certaine Ladie, and another vnto one <hi>Gaius;</hi> in either of which, as he thought it needfull, he comforted them, and exhorted them, and admoniſhed them. And this our Apoſtle ye may ſee how he <hi>taught</hi> both <hi>openly and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euery houſe:</hi> how he reproued ſins not onely in generall,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17.4.10.14.</note> but in particular noted the ſinnes of the inceſtuous perſon, of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>enaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> of <hi>Demas,</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the copper-ſmith, &amp;c: how he dealt with <hi>Philemon</hi> in particular for <hi>Oneſimus:</hi> how he comforted and admoniſhed <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And what elſe meaneth that of the Apoſtle, where he chargeth to be <hi>inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</note> but that the Miniſter of the Goſpell ſhould at all times and in all places, publikely and priuately, generally and particularly, take euery occaſion to profite Gods people, whether it be by teaching, by improuing, by rebuking, by exhorting, or how elſe ſoeuer it ſhall ſeeme needfull or profitable. For if we may but pull one brand out of the fire, if we may but conuert one ſinner from going aſtray out of his way, if we may but inſtruct one man in righteouſnes vnto ſaluation, euen by priuate and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular dealing with him, we ſhall not loſe our reward, but euen he ſhall be our crowne of reioycing in the preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt at his coming.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh they would at length remember this dutie, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their conſciences ſeared with an hote iron, vouchſafe not either publikely or priuately to teach, or exhort, or admoniſh the flock of God which dependeth on them. As publike with all, ſo priuate dealing with particulars will be ſeene to be needfull, if any man do but with halfe an eye looke into the ſtate of the people euery where. The ignorance in ſome, the wickedneſſe in others, the iarres amongſt others in euery place, ſhew plainly how needfull it is, vnto publike teaching
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:599:452"/> to adde alſo particular admonitions and exhortations. But they that cannot be drawne vnto the one, namely to teach their people in their aſſemblies, it is hardly to be hoped that they will deale with men in particular on the way, or at the plough-taile, or at the anuil, or at the ſhop-boord, how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoeuer it be. This place ſerueth not much to ſpeake vnto them, and therefore I let them alone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the perſon of <hi>Paul,</hi> I note his godly care to compoſe the ſtrifes of theſe two godly women <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche.</hi> For there being a iarre either betweene themſelues about ſome priuate matters, or betweene them &amp; the Church about ſome matter of religion, both himſelfe exhorteth them to be of one accord in the Lord, and alſo he dealeth with his faithfull yoke-fellow to helpe to order their matters, and to compoſe their ſtrifes, commending them as worthy that he ſhould do this for them. Whence I obſerue a very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable qualitie, as in the Miniſter of Chriſt, ſo in euery good Chriſtian, which is, both by themſelues and by all the meanes that they can make, to take vp ſuch quarrels as fall out among their brethren. It is regiſtred vnto the euerlaſting commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Cloë,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.</note> and her houſe, that when great diſſenſions and contentions broke out in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very deſirous to haue them ſtayed, and yet not able to ſtay them, aduertiſed <hi>Paul</hi> thereof, that he in his wiſedome might take ſome courſe to ſtay them. And our Apoſtle giues it for a precept vnto <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.23.</note> to <hi>put away fooliſh and vnlearned queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, knowing that they ingender ſtrife.</hi> Where the meaning in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is, that he muſt be ſo carefull to ſtay all ſtrife, that he muſt be carefull to take away euery thing which may be any occaſion of ſtrife. And our Sauiour pronounceth a bleſſing vpon them that make peace among their brethren, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are the peace-makers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 9.</note> 
                     <hi>for they ſhall be called the children of God.</hi> For God being the God of peace, the more that we haue peace amongſt our ſelues, and the more that we ſtudie and labour to make peace among others, the more like we are vnto God, and the more we ſhew our ſelues to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. So that we ſee, that to make peace and end ſtrifes, is very commendable both with God and men.</p>
                  <pb n="739" facs="tcp:599:452"/>
                  <p>This then firſt may teach vs to beware how we do ſow ſtrife and diſſenſion betwixt man and man. For looke how commendable a thing it is to make peace and end ſtrifes; ſo intollerable and odious a thing it is to blow the bellowes of diſcord amongſt brethren and neighbours: and as they that make peace, do thereby ſhew themſelues to be the children of God, with whom dwelleth peace; ſo thoſe ſeditious fire-brands that delight to ſtirre vp ſtrife among their brethren, and to ſet men by the eares together, ſhew plainly that they are the ſonnes of that wicked one who cannot abide that bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhould dwel together in vnitie.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 6.16.17 18</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe ſix things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon) doth the Lord hate, yea his ſoule abhorreth ſeuen, The haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie eyes, a lying tongue, hands that ſhed innocent bloud, an heart that imagineth wicked enterpriſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">19</note> 
                     <hi>feete that be ſwift in running to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, a falſe witneſſe that ſpeaketh lies, and him that raiſeth vp contentions among brethren.</hi> All theſe ſeuen things the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, yea his ſoule abhorreth the ſeuenth as plaine murder. For what is murder if this be not, to rend in ſunder the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame bodie, by ſowing debates and diuiſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and ſo by braules, and iarres, and quarrelling, to kill both the ſoule and the bodie?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.14.</note> 
                     <hi>The beginning of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Salomon, is as one that openeth the waters:</hi> ſo that he that bloweth the bellowes of contention, and openeth the way vnto ſtrife amongſt neighbours, is as he that by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp a ſluce, letteth in the waters vpon a countrey, and ſo drowneth the whole countrey: which alſo ſheweth that ſuch make-bates are murtherers.</p>
                  <p>Let them looke vnto this, which either by priuie whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, or open detractions, or any falſe ſuggeſtion whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, either ſeeke to make variance where there is none, or where they perceiue ſome litle diſlike, there adde fire vnto heate, and ſet them as farre at oddes as they can. Of what root ſoeuer they be that are ſuch, they are the ſonnes of Belial, and no leſſe then murderers.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 22.10.</note> And therefore as <hi>Salomon</hi> giueth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice touching the ſcorner, the like do I touching ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious man; <hi>Caſt out the ſcorner,</hi> ſaith he; Caſt out the make-bate, ſay I, <hi>and ſtrife ſhall go out;</hi> caſt out the make-bate out of companie, countrey, commonwealth, citie, houſe where thou <pb n="740" facs="tcp:599:453"/> dwelleſt, ſo contention and reproch ſhall ceaſſe. The truth euer will abide the light, and feareth not to ſpeake with any man in the gate: but theſe are commonly whiſperers, and loue rather to ſpeake in the care then on the houſe top. Suſpect them therefore by their priuie whiſpering, and when once thou knoweſt them, for euer afterwards be thou ware of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach vs, not onely to ſtudie to liue in peace our ſelues with all men, but farther, when others are at oddes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</note> to make peace betweene them. <hi>Follow peace with all men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the Romanes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18.</note> 
                     <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as in you is, haue peace with all men.</hi> And ſurely a moſt bleſſed thing it is to ſee men to be of one accord in the Lord: witneſſe the Pſalmiſt, where he ſaith, <hi>Behold how good and ioyfull a thing it is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1.</note> 
                     <hi>brethren to dwell together in vnitie.</hi> But the ſeruants of God are not onely to be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able themſelues, but when either there are open iarres, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination thereunto, they ſhould labour by all meanes both by themſelues and others to ſet them at one. It was a good ſpeech of <hi>Abraham</hi> vnto <hi>Lot,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.8.</note> when he ſaid vnto him, <hi>Let there be no ſtrife, I pray thee, betweene me and thee, neither betweene mine heardmen and thine heardmen; for we be brethren.</hi> In imitation whereof, when ſtrife is, or is like to be, we are to interpoſe our ſelues, and to ſay, Let there be no ſtrife, I pray you, betweene you; for ye are brethren: ye are neigbours and friends; ye haue <hi>one Lord, one faith, one Baptiſme, and one hope of your vocation:</hi> be ye therefore one amongſt your ſelues: <hi>Let all bitterneſſe, and anger, and wrath, crying, and euill ſpeaking be put away from you, with all maliciouſneſſe: and be ye courteous one towards another, and tender hearted, forgiuing one another, if either haue a quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other, euen as God for Chriſts ſake forgaue you.</hi> Yea and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for going to law one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo are we to ſay vnto them that any way ſtriue, <hi>Why ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer ye not wrong? why rather ſuſtaine ye not harme,</hi> then fall at ſuch quarrelling one with another? Thus, I ſay, ſhould we in hatred of ſtrife, and loue of peace, as peace-makers labour to compoſe ſtrifes, and to make peace where it is not.</p>
                  <pb n="741" facs="tcp:599:453"/>
                  <p>But what commonly ſay wee in ſuch caſes? One ſaith, It were very well done to take vp their quarrells, and to make them friends. Another ſaith, that he loues not to meddle in other mens matters, and to make himſelfe ſome buſineſſe where happly he ſhall haue little thankes. Another ſports himſelfe at their contentions, and ſaith with himſelfe; So, ſo, there goes the game. Another haply ſheweth his diſlike of their iarres, and puts in a word to friend them, and then he thinkes he hath done well. But not many in ſuch caſes deale both by themſelues and by others, and labour by all meanes to take vp their quarrels, that they may be of one accord in the Lord. Well, if when wee were enemies vnto God, and God was angrie with vs to deſtroy vs for euer, Chriſt Ieſus the Sonne of the euerliuing God had not come in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinfull fleſh to make peace betweene God and vs, what had become of vs? If God had not ſent his Sonne, and if he had not come to reconcile vs vnto God, our portion had beene with the diuell and his angells in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for euer. Let vs, men and brethren, be followers of Chriſt, let vs follow <hi>Abraham,</hi> and our Apoſtle. Let vs not onely labour to haue peace with God, and to be at peace one with another, but when wee ſee that any vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is, or is like to be betweene man and man, let vs labour, as much as we can, to ſet them at one. Let vs hate ſtrife and debate both in our ſelues and in others, and let vs loue peace and agreement both in our ſelues and in others. And then ſurely the God of peace ſhall be with vs to bleſſe vs, and to giue vs his peace, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding. And let this be obſerued from the perſon of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing which I note, is in the perſons of <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche.</hi> Wherein firſt I note the religious affection of theſe two vertuous women; for by conference of this place with that in the <hi>Acts,</hi> it may appeare, that when the Goſpell was firſt preached at <hi>Philippi,</hi> they not onely gladly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Goſpell, but ſtood much for the defence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell againſt them that perſecuted the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, and often aſſembled themſelues together with other women without the towne beſides the riuer to pray, and to heare the
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:599:454"/> Word preached. Whereupon it is that the Apoſtle here ſaith, that they laboured with him in the Goſpell, nor with him onely, but with <hi>Clement</hi> alſo, and with other his fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the worke of the Miniſterie. Here then is a good patterne for all women to looke vpon, that they be alike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly affected as theſe women were, &amp; giue like teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thereof as they did. There is no priuiledge vnto them by their ſexe from this, but as all the reſt of Gods children, ſo they ſhould embrace pure religion from their hearts, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelues in the law of their God day and night, and ſeeke the Lord from the ground of their hearts.

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13.</note> were women. Neither haue they onely beene religiouſly affected, and ſuch as feared God, and walked in his wayes, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many haue mainly ſtoode for the defence of the Goſpel, and hazarded their liues. Examples we haue in <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> vnto whom the Apoſtle giueth this teſtimonie, that for his life ſhe laid downe her owne necke:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.4.</note> and likewiſe in this place of <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche,</hi> of whom ye ſee the Apoſtle ſaith, that they ſtroue with him and others in the Goſpell, that it might haue a free paſſage, and that they might ſpeake the Word boldly. Seeing then that theſe things are written for your learning, iudge with your ſelues how religiouſly ye ought to be affected towards the truth of Chriſt Ieſus. Let their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſtirre vp your holy mindes, and let it not ſeeme grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto you with holy <hi>Mary</hi> to ſit you down at Ieſus foot,
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:599:454"/> and heare him preaching in his Miniſters. Nay, let it not grieue you, boldly to ſtand in the defence of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, and if the will of the Lord be ſo, to lay downe your liues for that truth which ye haue learned and receiued in Chriſt Ieſus. If ye ſhould look no further but vnto exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of your owne ſexe, ye might haue ſufficient encitement hereunto. As therefore at this day ye doe, ſo go forward to receiue with meekneſſe that word which is able to ſaue your ſoules. Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you plenteouſly, and let your religious minds be knowne vnto all men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the perſons of <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche,</hi> I note a breach and falling out, either betwixt themſelues, or betwixt them and the Church: For, in that he exhorteth them to be of one accord in the Lord, it is plaine that there was a breach and falling out. Whence I obſerue, that the children of God, how religiouſly affected ſoeuer they be, yet ſo long as they liue, are ſubiect vnto their falls, and ſubiect vnto diuers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered affections, as anger, diſcord, and the like. We ſee how <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were drawne on vnto ſhrewd diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation for feare of the Iewes.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.13.</note> We ſee how the loue of the world drew on <hi>Demas</hi> to forſake <hi>Paul</hi> for a time,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</note> and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. We ſee how ſome haue bene almoſt ſeduced from the way of truth by falſe teachers, as it is like theſe two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were, if the breach were betweene them and the church. Againe, we ſee ſuch a heate and breach to haue fallen out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as that they parted companies,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 15.39.</note> the one going one way, and the other way: ſo that whom Satan had often ſifted &amp; winowed before, now a very little matter and ſmall occaſion ſet them at verie great oddes. And many ſuch falls and diſordered affections are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſubiect vnto in this life, as might farther at large be proued. The reaſon is, becauſe though they be led by the Spirit, yet are they not wholly guided by the Spirit, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they walke after the fleſh, and not after the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Here then firſt, let the children of God learne to humble themſelues, and to walke before the Lord with feare and trembling. The manifold falles and diſordered affections whereunto they are ſubiect, may keepe them in a reuerent
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:599:455"/> and ſonne-like awe, that they preſume not aboue that is meete; for by their falls they may ſee what ſtrength there is in themſelues to ſtand, if the Lord ſhould not ſuſtaine and vphold them. As therefore the Apoſtle exhorteth, ſo let all of vs <hi>make an end of our ſaluation with feare and trembling,</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but not doubting, becauſe he is faithful which hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; ſtanding in awe but ſinning not, euen ſtanding in awe, leſt we doe ſinne and diſpleaſe the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence we may learne, not preſently ſharply to cenſure men vpon their breaches, or vpon their falls; for they are no other things then do befall the children of God. Rather we are, if they be ſuch as haue made a good profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth, in ſuch caſes to helpe them, as here our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes: firſt, to labour to raiſe them, if they be fallen, and if they be at oddes, to ſet them at one, euen becauſe of their holy profeſſion, leſt the way of truth ſhould be euill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: for that our Apoſtle makes the reaſon vnto his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yoke-fellow, why he would haue him to help theſe god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly women, and to ſet them at one, euen becauſe they were ſuch as had ſtriuen with him in the Goſpell.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heard the Apoſtles particular exhorta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, firſt, vnto <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche,</hi> verſe 2. ſecondly, vnto his faithfull yoke fellow, verſe 3. Vnto <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche,</hi> that they would be of one accord in the Lord; vnto his faithfull yoke-fellow, that he would be a meanes to ſet them at one, becauſe they were ſuch as for their labour with him and other his fellow-labourers in the Goſpell, were worthie that he ſhould doe this for them.</p>
                  <pb n="745" facs="tcp:599:455"/>
                  <p>One thing yet remaineth to be noted from the exhortation vnto his faithfull yoke-fellow, which is, the Apoſtles affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his fellow-labourers, that their names were in the booke of life. Whereby he meaneth that their life was as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſealed vp with God, as if their names had bene writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a booke to that purpoſe. For the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which phraſe and manner of ſpeech; firſt, we are to know, that in the Scriptures there is mention made of three bookes attributed vnto God. One, the booke of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence; another the booke of Gods iudgement; a third, the booke of life. The booke of Gods prouidence, is his fore-knowledge of all things before euer they were: And of this the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Thine eyes did ſee me when I was without forme:</hi> for in thy booke were all things written which in continuance <hi>were faſhioned, when there was none of them before.</hi> Where by the booke of God is meant, his fore-knowledge whereby he knew all things from euerlaſting. The booke of Gods iudgement, is his knowledge of all our thoughts, words, and workes, which in the laſt day ſhall ſo clearely be preſented vnto vs, as if they were then read out of a booke, and according to which he ſhall then iudge vs: And of this <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh where he ſaith; <hi>I ſaw the dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apocal.</hi> 20.12.</note> 
                     <hi>both great and ſmall ſtand before God, and the bookes were opened, and the dead were iudged of thoſe things which were written in the bookes according to their workes.</hi> Where by the bookes is meant that knowledge of all our thoughts, words, and works which God in the laſt iudgement ſhal preſent vnto euery mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo clearely as if a man ſhould open a booke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were all written, and diſtinctly read them out of that booke. The third booke which is called the booke of life, euen of eternall life, is the euerlaſting fore-knowledge of God, whereby he ſpecially and particularly knew from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting who are his, and by a ſpeciall care preſerueth them vnto life as certainely, as if their names were regiſtred in a booke to that purpoſe. And of this the holy Ghoſt maketh often mention in holy Scripture:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>becauſe their names are written in heauen.</hi> In the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>He that ouercommeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apocal.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall be clothed in white aray, and I will not put out his name out of the booke of life.</hi> And againe, <hi>Whoſoeuer was not found written in the booke of life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">20.15.</note> 
                     <hi>was caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apocal.</hi> 21.27</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>There ſhall enter into this Citie no vncleane thing, neyther whoſoeuer worketh abomination or lies, but they which are written in the Lambes booke of life.</hi> Thus ye ſee mention of three books attributed vnto God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, one of prouidence, another of iudgement, and a third of life, which here our Apoſtle ſpeaketh of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to know that no materiall booke is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly attributed vnto God, as though he did write any thing in a booke, but onely by a borrowed ſpeech, borrowed from the manner or them that for their better remembrance of things, write them in a booke; ſo to imply, that God knowes all things, and that they are alwayes had in remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as if they were in a book. And therefore we defined his booke of prouidence, to be his fore-knowledge of all things before euer they were, whereby he knew them as wel from euerlaſting, as if they had bene written in a booke from euerlaſting. His booke of iudgement likewiſe we defined to be, his knowledge of all our thoughts, words, and workes, which in the laſt iudgement he ſhall preſent vnto euery mans conſcience, ſo clearely as if they were all read out of a booke, and according to which he ſhall then iudge vs. And laſtly, the booke of life we defined to be, the euerlaſting fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, whereby he ſpecially and particularly knew who are his, and by a ſpeciall and peculiar care preſerueth them vnto life as certainly as if their names were billed in a
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:599:456"/> booke, and regiſtred to be had in remembrance before him for euer. So that mention of ſuch bookes in the Scripture is not made in reſpect of God, as if he vſed, or needed to vſe any booke to any purpoſe; but for vs, and for our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that we, by the manner which we ſee vſed amongſt men, may the better conceiue and know, that God knew all things from euerlaſting, that in the laſt day all things ſhall be naked in his ſight, and that he knoweth all his by head, ſo that he hath a ſpeciall care ouer them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things thus noted, for the better vnderſtanding of the phraſe and manner of ſpeech here vſed by the Apoſtle, let vs now come a little nearer to the opening of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe words. The ſpeech of the Apoſtle is touching his fellow-labourers, which had laboured with him in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, when the Church was firſt planted at <hi>Philippi:</hi> Of whom he ſaith, that their names were in the booke of life. Whereby he meaneth, that they were of the number of thoſe whom God had choſen in Chriſt Ieſus vnto euerlaſting life, ſo that their life was as ſurely ſealed vp with God, as if he had taken their particular names, and written them in a book to remember them, and to giue vnto them that which he had purpoſed from euerlaſting. This being the meaning, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth now that we ſee what obſeruation we may gather hence for our further vſe.</p>
                  <p>But firſt a doubt is to be anſwered, touching ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction which may ſeeme to be betweene this of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here, and that of the ſame Apoſtle, where it is ſayd, that <hi>the Lord onely knoweth who are his.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</note> For if the Lord alone know who are his, as there it is, then how doth he here ſay of his fellow-labourers, that their names were in the booke of life, ſo plainly ſetting it downe as if he knew it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I anſwer, That albeit the Apoſtle in the place vnto <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> onely ſay, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.15.</note> as alſo our Sauiour himſelfe in another place ſaith, <hi>I know whom I haue choſen;</hi> yet in the truth of the thing it is true, that he alone knoweth who are his, and that he alone knoweth whom he hath choſen: as that place in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> makes more plaine, where it is thus ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apocal.</hi> 2.17.</note> 
                     <hi>To him that ouercommeth will I giue to eate
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:599:457"/> of the Manna that is hid, and will giue him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, which no man knoweth ſauing he that receiueth it.</hi> For hereby it is ſignified, that no perſon liuing knoweth who are renewed in Chriſt Ieſus vnto righteouſnes, and true holines, but God onely, and the ſpirit of man which is in man. Thus then we ſay, that God alone knoweth who are his, and whom he hath choſen, abſolutely, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; ſo that no man can abſolutely and of himſelfe ſay of another, that he is the choſen of God, that his name is in the booke of life. Yet may the Lord, and ſometimes doth he reueale vnto his children that which he alone, abſolutely, and of himſelfe knoweth, as the reuelations vnto <hi>Abraham, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and the Prophets manifeſtly proue. And whether in that abundance of reuelations which the Lord ſhewed vnto our Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</note> and whereof he ſpeaketh ſomewhere, he had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome reuelation touching the election of ſome, and the reprobation of others, I cannot affirme. Many are of opinion that the election of ſome, and the reprobation of others were reuealed by God vnto him. And ſo it may be, that the Lord who alone, abſolutely, and by himſelfe, knew whether the names of thoſe his fellow-laborers were written in the booke of life, reuealed by his holy Spirit vnto our Apoſtle, that their names were written in the booke of life.</p>
                  <p>But I rather thinke that here he thus ſpoke as he thought by the rule of charitie. For, what ſaith the Apoſtle in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of charitie?<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.</note> namely, <hi>that it beleeueth all things, and hopeth all things:</hi> yea, and where it ſeeth certaine fruites and effects of election and ſaluation, there it is certainly to be perſwaded of election and ſaluation. Our Apoſtle therefore ſeeing how faithfully thoſe his fellow-labourers had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the worke of the Miniſterie with him, in the planting of the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> how conſtantly they had walked in the truth, notwithſtanding the great oppoſition that was againſt them, how vnblameably they had had their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation amongſt men, in charitie thus he iudged, that their names were in the booke of life. And this may verie well ſtand with the other, that the Lord onely knoweth who are his. For that which properly belongeth vnto the Lord,
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:599:457"/> abſolutely and by himſelfe to know whoſe names are in the booke of life, that the Apoſtle aſſumeth not to himſelfe; but ſeeing the fruites of their election in their liues, he by the rule of charitie thus iudgeth of their ſaluation, that euerlaſting life was ſurely ſealed vp for them with God.</p>
                  <p>To come then vnto my note, the thing which here I note, is the Apoſtles charitable iudgement of his fellow-labourers in the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. By their fruites he iudged that they were branches of the true vine; vpon their holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and conſtant endeuor to increaſe the kingdome of Chriſt Ieſus, he pronounceth that their names were written in the booke of life. Whence firſt my obſeruation in generall is, that the children of God not onely may and ought certainly to be perſwaded of their owne ſaluation in Chriſt Ieſus, but further, that they are by the rule of charitie to aſſure themſelues of the ſaluation of ſuch of their brethren as walke in the truth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their conuerſation honeſt. For albeit this be moſt true, that not any can be ſo certaine of any other mans election or ſaluation as of his owne, becauſe he feeleth onely in himſelfe the teſtimony of the Spirit witneſſing vnto his ſpirit that he is the ſonne of God, and becauſe onely in himſelfe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his faith towards God, and his loue towards all Saints, not onely by the outward fruites thereof, but like wiſe by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions thereof which he feeles in his owne ſoule: yet may the children of God by ſuch outward fruites and effects of their election as they ſhall ſee in their brethren, according to the rule of charitie iudge that they are the choſen children of God, and heires of ſaluation. So we ſee that the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Romanes, Corinthians, Epheſians,</hi> writeth vnto them as <hi>Saints by calling, ſanctified in Chriſt Ieſus, choſen in him before the foundation of the world,</hi> and <hi>predeſtinated to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt vnto God.</hi> And why did he thus iudge of them? Euen becauſe of their communion with the Saints in the Goſpel of Chriſt, becauſe of the teſtification of their faith, and of their loue towards all Saints, whereby they ſhewed themſelues to be partakers of the fatneſſe of the true oliue Chriſt Ieſus. So <hi>Peter</hi> writing vnto the ſtrangers that dwelt here and there throughout <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia</hi>
                     <pb n="750" facs="tcp:599:458"/> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> calleth them <hi>the elect of God.</hi> And why? Euen becauſe of their conſtant faith, conſtant loue, and conſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the Church of Chriſt Ieſus. So <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth them vnto whom he wrote, <hi>the ſonnes of God:</hi> and the Lady vnto whom he wrote, <hi>the elect Ladie,</hi> becauſe they continued in the Church, and walked in the truth.</p>
                  <p>Do we then ſee in our brethren the outward fruites of an holy vocation, of regeneration and ſanctification? Do we ſee them make an holy profeſſion of the bleſſed truth of Chriſt Ieſus, giue good teſtimonie of a ſincere faith in Chriſt Ieſus, walk in holy obedience towards God, and loue towards their brethren, faithfully labour in the workes of their calling, and denying vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world? Of ſuch we may and are to perſwade our ſelues that they are reſerued vnto the ſame inheritance in heauen with vs, and of them we may ſay, that they are the ſonnes of God, elect in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord vnto eternall ſaluation, prepared to be ſhewed in the laſt times. And beſides this that the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of the Apoſtles warranteth vs hereunto, the rule alſo of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie directeth vs ſo to do. For, as before we heard, <hi>Charitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth all things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.</note> 
                     <hi>charitie hopeth all things.</hi> Which yet is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as if charitie were fooliſh, raſhly to beleeue euery thing that is told, and there to hope where there is no cauſe of hope: for that the Wiſeman maketh a note of a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 14.15.</note> where he thus ſaith, <hi>The fooliſh will beleeue euery thing.</hi> But ſo charitie beleeueth all things and hopeth all things, as that it keepes it ſelfe within the rule of pietie, wiſedome and religion. If the thing diſpleaſe God, be repugnant to the truth, be hurtfull or diſgracefull to any of Gods children, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie beleeueth it not, hopeth it not. But where there are good tokens of Chriſtianitie, plaine ſignes of a ſincere faith, euident teſtimonies of an holy obedience, there ſurely the rule of charitie bids vs beleeue and hope the beſt, and there we may be bold to ſay, that they are the ſonnes of God, that their names are written in the booke of life. And is it not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours rule, that we ſhould iudge of the tree by the fruite, for that <hi>a good tree bringeth not forth euill fruite,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18.</note> 
                     <hi>nor an ill tree good
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:599:458"/> fruite?</hi> If it beare grapes, will any man iudge it to be a thorne? if it bring forth figs, will any man iudge it to be a thiſtle? Nay, by the fruite the tree is knowne what it is; and if the fruite be good, it may thereby be knowne that the tree is good. Right ſo, if we haue our fruite in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, it may thereby be knowne, that we are the branches of the true vine Chriſt Ieſus. Whether then we looke vnto the example of the Apoſtles, or vnto the rule of charitie, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles followed, or vnto that rule of Chriſt, to diſcerne of the tree by the fruite, we ſee that the children of God may not onely perſwade themſelues of their owne ſaluation in Chriſt Ieſus, but further alſo may certainly iudge of the ſaluation of their godly brethren.</p>
                  <p>Now ſee, <hi>viri, fratres,</hi> men &amp; brethren, the great neceſſitie that there is, that we ſhould be thus perſwaded one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen ſo great, as that without it, the bond of peace, loue, and Chriſtianitie cannot be maintained. For how can we loue them, of whom we haue no hope that they ſhall be heires of the ſame ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with vs? How can we haue peace with them, of whom we are not perſwaded that they are at peace with God? How can we pray with them, and ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in heauen,</hi> touching whom we doubt whether God be their Father? How can we communicate in the Lords Supper with them, of whom we doubt whether they be ioyned with vs in the ſame communion of Saints? How can we liue with them as with our brethren and beloued, if we doubt whether they be within the ſame couenant of grace with vs? A ſhallow peace, and a ſhadow of loue, and a ſemblance of Chriſtianitie there may be, but ſuch as vnder a colour onely deceiueth, and hath no ſoundneſſe in it. It is this perſwaſion of our owne minds touching our brethren, that they are in one couenant of grace with vs, that they are members of the ſame myſticall bodie of Chriſt Ieſus with vs, that they are heires of the ſame ſaluation with vs; that through one God, one faith, one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, one Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, they and we ſhall reigne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one kingdome; it is this, I ſay, that linkes vs in the true bond of peace, loue, and Chriſtianitie; and either this muſt be, or elſe that cannot be.</p>
                  <pb n="752" facs="tcp:599:459"/>
                  <p>If then we deſire to be knit together in the true bond of peace, loue, and Chriſtianitie, let vs ſo walke that we may be thus perſwaded one of another. As we are called to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, ſo let vs walke in the truth, and let vs keep faſt the profeſſion of our hope vnto the end. Let vs follow the truth in loue, and in all things grow vp into him which is the head, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is Chriſt, rooted &amp; built in him, &amp; ſtabliſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith. Let our loue one towards another abound yet more &amp; more, in all knowledge and in all iudgement. Let vs haue our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation ſuch as becometh the Saints of God, and let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for things honeſt, not onely before the Lord, but alſo before men. Thus ſhall we haue a ſure ſeale vnto our ſoules, thus ſhall we giue a good teſtimonie vnto others that we are the ſonnes of God, and thus ſhall we be knit together in one mind and in one iudgement, that we may walke together in the houſe of God as friends.</p>
                  <p>My next obſeruation hence, is for the comfort of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in particular. The Apoſtle, ye ſee, vpon the faithfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of thoſe that had laboured with him in the preaching of the Goſpell at <hi>Philippi,</hi> pronounceth that their names were in the booke of life. Whence I obſerue this for the comfort of the good Miniſter of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus: If he haue faithfully and painfully laboured in the worke of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, if he haue in all good conſcience inſtructed and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his people, and endeuoured to increaſe the kingdome of Chriſt Ieſus, his reward is with God, and his life is as ſurely ſealed vp with God, as if his name were written in a booke to that purpoſe. To which purpoſe is that alſo of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Euery man ſhall receiue wages according to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. If any mans worke that he hath built vpon abide, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue wages,</hi> which wages the Apoſtle calleth elſewhere <hi>a crowne of righteouſneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note> 
                     <hi>which the Lord the righteous Iudge ſhall giue</hi> him <hi>at that day.</hi> Yea but what if he labour all night, and catch nothing? What if he run in vaine, and ſpend his ſtrength in vaine and for nothing amongſt his people?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 49.4.5.</note> Yet is his <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Lord, and his worke with his God. Though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall he be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and his God ſhall be his ſtrength.</hi> So that howſoeuer his labour be in
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:599:459"/> vaine vnto them, yet ſhal it not be in vaine in the Lord; though they be not taught, yet ſhall not he loſe his reward. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath bene faithfull,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21.</note> he ſhall enter into his maiſters ioy. A good comfort, after he haue borne the burden and heate of the day, to receiue ſuch a penie. But what part of this comfort hath he, that being ſet in the vineyard to dreſſe it, neither hedgeth, nor ditcheth, nor gathereth out ſtones of it, nor planteth, nor watereth, but ſtandeth all the day idle in it? No more then the watchman that giueth no warning:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.30.</note> no more then he that diggeth his talent in the earth. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort belongeth vnto him alone that laboureth.</p>
                  <p>Now ſee then, men and brethren, what this ſhould teach you. Is it ſo that the Lord rewardeth him that faithfully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth in the vineyard with euerlaſting life, but is angrie with him that loytereth, euen vnto death? Behold then what care the Lord hath ouer you, &amp; what dutie ye owe vnto him again. For wherefore doth he ſend out the laborers vnto you? Wherfore doth he ſo reward the labors of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> labor faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully amongſt you &amp; admoniſh you? Wherefore is he ſo angry with them that do not labour amongſt you? Is it not for your ſakes, that ye may be prepared an holy people vnto the Lord, that ye may be inſtructed in righteouſneſſe vnto ſaluation, and that no holy dutie may be neglected towards you? Conſider then with your ſelues, what it is that the Lord looketh for from you; grapes, or wilde grapes? It is iudgement and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, mercie and truth, peace and loue, integritie and holineſſe, that he lookes for, and that he requires for ſuch his louing kindneſſe towards you, for ſuch his continuall care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you. And if theſe things be amongſt you and abound, then bleſſed ſhall ye be of the Lord, and ye ſhall eate of the fruite of your wayes. But if he looke for iudgement, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold oppreſſion; for righteouſneſſe and behold a crying, for mercie and behold crueltie, for truth and behold falſhood, for peace and behold diſcord, for loue and behold hatred, for integritie and behold diſſimulation and hypocriſie, for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and behold profaneneſſe and all kind of iniquitie; then what remaineth but a remouing of our candleſtick out of his place? what, but a fearefull looking for of iudgement, wherein
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:599:460"/> ſhall be indignation and wrath vnto them that diſobey the truth, and obey vnrighteouſneſſe. Seeing therefore the Lord in his tender care ouer vs, ſendeth forth labourers vnto vs, and ſo plentifully rewardeth their holy labours amongſt vs; let vs againe with all care conſider what he requireth of vs for ſuch his care ouer vs, and in all obedience addreſſe our ſelues vnto that dutie. His will is, that we ſhould hearken vnto the voice of them that come in his Name, and he hath in nothing ſo much delight, as when his word is obeyed. His care ouer vs in ſending his Miniſters vnto vs early and late, ſhal be repayed by vs with a good dutie towards him, if we will hearken and obey. Let vs therefore hearken and obey, and ſo ſhall we reape vnto our ſelues a good reward. For he that plentifully rewardeth him that laboureth amongſt vs and admoniſheth vs, will alſo in like mercie reward vs, if in vs the fruites of his labours grow vp in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe. And let this ſuffice to be ſpoken by occaſion of the Apoſtles affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation touching his fellow-labourers, that their names are in the booke of life.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing ſpoken before of the Apoſtles exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> in generall, and likewiſe of his two particular exhortations, the one vnto <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche,</hi> the other vnto his faithfull yoke-fellow: the laſt day we ſpent that whole time in ſpeaking of the Apoſtles affirmation touching his fellow-labourers, that their names were in the book of life, which the Apoſtle addeth vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of his particular exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his faithful yoke felow.</p>
                  <pb n="755" facs="tcp:599:460"/>
                  <p>Now the Apoſtle hauing made theſe particular exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto thoſe godly women <hi>Euodias</hi> and <hi>Syntyche,</hi> and vnto his faithfull yoke-fellow in their behalfe, he goeth from thoſe particularities, and againe maketh ſundrie exhortations vnto all the <hi>Philippians.</hi> The words which I haue read vnto you, ye ſee, are an exhortation vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> to reioyce in the Lord. Where, the thing whereunto he exhorteth, as ye ſee, is to reioyce. A thing which the ſenſuall man can quickly lay hold on, who loues to reioyce, and to cheere himſelfe in the dayes of his fleſh; which yet might now ſeeme vnſeaſonable vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who liued in the midſt of a naughtie and crooked nation, by whom they were hated euen for the truths ſake which they profeſſed. Marke therefore wherein the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtle would they ſhould reioyce, namely in the Lord. And here the ſenſuall man that haply would catch hold when it is ſaid, <hi>reioyce,</hi> by and by when it is added, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> will let his hold go. But they that by reaſon of the billowes and waues of the troubleſome ſea of this world, cannot brooke the ſpeech, when it is ſaid <hi>reioyce,</hi> are to lay ſure hold-faſt vpon it, when it is added, <hi>reioyce in the Lord:</hi> which hold-faſt once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that they might for euer keepe it ſure, in the third place it is added, <hi>reioyce in the Lord alwayes,</hi> to note the conſtancie that ſhould be in the Chriſtian ioy. O but the Apoſtle was not well aduiſed of his ſpeech, to exhort them to reioyce in the Lord alway. Not well aduiſed? Yes: <hi>Reioyce in the Lord always, and againe I ſay, reioyce in the Lord alwayes.</hi> He repeateth it, to make the better impreſſion of a thing ſo needfull. So that here we haue the Apoſtles exhortation to <hi>reioyce,</hi> but <hi>in the Lord;</hi> not with a momentany or flitting ioy, but <hi>alwayes,</hi> both in weale and in woe; not vnaduiſedly deliuered, or as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no moment, but doubled, as ſeriouſly deliuered, and to be hearkened vnto. And let this ſuffice for a generall view of the points of this exhortation, and for the meaning of the words. Now let vs ſee what notes ariſe hence for our own vſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which I note in this exhortation, is, that the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>reioyce in the Lord,</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perſwading ioy and reioycing, but ſo limiting it, that it be in the Lord, not onely allowing it as lawfull, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:599:461"/> it as requiſite that they ſhould reioyce in the Lord. Whence I obſerue what the Chriſtian mans reioycing is, wherein he may and ought to reioyce: his reioycing is, and may, and ought to be in the Lord. It is a common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie obiection againſt them that from their ſoules deſire to be followers of the holy Apoſtle in a ſincere embracing of the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, that they are melancholike men, ſad and auſtere men, men which can abide no mirth, which can away with no ioy and reioycing. But let them not deceiue you.<note place="margin">

                  <p>What is then the reioycing which we teach?

Haue we then whatſoeuer bleſſings we haue from the Lord, and doth the Lord ſupply whatſoeuer we want, fo farre forth as he ſees it to be expedient for vs, and good for his owne glorie? See then what cauſe we haue to reioyce in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and what cauſe is there why we ſhould reioyce in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but in the Lord? Riches, honour, ſtrength, beauty, and whatſoeuer elſe the world moſt eſteemeth of, what is it elſe but vanitie, and vexation of the ſpirit? Amongſt other things moſt precious in the life of man, wiſedome is more to be ſought after then gold and ſiluer, and not to be weighed with precious ſtones; righteouſnes moſt commendeth man vnto man, and holineſſe moſt commendeth man vnto God. And yet what is our wiſedome, what is our righteouſneſſe, what is our holineſſe that we ſhould reioyce in them? Be it that we haue the wiſedome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> be it that we be as, righteous as <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Iob;</hi> be it that we be as holie as <hi>Dauid,</hi> the holie Prophets and Apoſtles; yet for all this, if we will come vnto God, we muſt lay all theſe aſide, and Chriſt Ieſus he muſt be our wiſedome, and righteouſnes, and holineſſe. Whatſoeuer our wiſedome be, it will not leade vs vnto God; whatſoeuer our righteouſneſſe be, it will not preſent vs righteous before God; whatſoeuer our holineſſe be, we cannot ſtand in it in the iudgement before God. Nay, when we come vnto God, we muſt renounce our wiſedome as fooliſhneſſe, we muſt count our righteouſneſſe loſſe and dung, we muſt abandon all conceit of holineſſe, as alſo we ſee our Apoſtle did: who though he were of the kindred of Iſrael, of the tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> an Ebrew of the Ebrews, by profeſſion a Phariſie, as zealous of the tradition of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as any, and as vnrebukeable touching the righteouſnes of the law as any; yet when once he came to the knowledge of Chriſt, he counted all theſe things as no vantage at all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but loſſe and dung, for Chriſt his ſake. For herein is
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:599:463"/> our reioycing, that <hi>Chriſt is made of God vnto vs wiſedome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> 
                     <hi>and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> as it is written. Nay, to go yet further, what are our faith, hope, and loue that we ſhould reioyce in them? To be ſtrong in faith, to be perfect in loue, to be ſtedfaſt in hope, are things for which we ſhould pray alwayes with all maner prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſpirit. But if we ſhall reioyce and repoſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the ſtrength of our faith, in the perfection of our loue, in the ſtedfaſtneſſe of our hope, then we are aboliſhed from Chriſt, and our reioycing is not good. It is Chriſt Ieſus in whom we muſt beleeue, whom we muſt loue, &amp; in whom we muſt hope. Our faith muſt be built vpon him, our loue muſt be grounded on him, our hope muſt be ſtabliſhed in him, and in him we muſt reioyce. Thus then we ſee that we haue not any thing to reioyce in without vs, nor yet in our wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, or holineſſe, nor yet in our faith, hope, or loue. We muſt reioyce in the Lord, and in him it well becometh the Saints to be ioyfull.</p>
                  <p>Let me therefore in the bowels of Chriſt Ieſus beſeech you to reioyce, not as the world doth in the pleaſures of ſinne, and the vanities of this life, but to reioyce in the Lord the ſtrong God of our ſaluation. Ye ſee the exhortations of the holy Ghoſt, and the examples of godly men, and ye ſee what great cauſe we haue to reioyce in the Lord, and how little cauſe we haue to reioyce in any thing elſe. All reioycing in the world, what is it in compariſon of this reioycing in the Lord? It is as the morning cloud, or as the morning dew, it vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth away; or as it is in the place of <hi>Iob, It is ſhort, and but a moment.</hi> Nay, in it onely is true ioy, and ſound reioycing. Other ioyes may for a while pleaſe the outward ſenſe, but the ioy that quickens the heart, and cheeres the ſoule, is the ioy in the holy Ghoſt. Other reioycing, the more it is, the worſe it is; but this, the more it is, the better it is; and the more we do reioyce in the Lord, the more cauſe we ſhall finde we haue to reioyce in the Lord. Reioyce therefore in the Lord alwayes, and againe I ſay, reioyce.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note in the Apoſtles exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that he exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> to reioyce in the Lord,
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:599:464"/> not for a day, or for a ſeaſon, not by fits, or when he makes his face to ſhine on them, but <hi>to reioyce in the Lord alwayes,</hi> as well in aduerſity, as in proſperity. Whence I obſerue the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which is in Chriſtian reioycing, whereby it is knowne indeed to be Chriſtian. The conſtancy of our Chriſtian reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is, to reioyce in the Lord always, as wel when he ſeemeth to hide away his face from vs, as when he maketh his face to ſhine vpon vs. This conſtancie of reioycing, the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> vnto, where he ſaith vnto them, <hi>Reioyce euermore.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.16.</note> And herein is the triall of our ioy, whether it be Chriſtian indeed: for as it is ſaid of ſome hearers of the word,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13.</note> that <hi>for a while they beleeue, but in time of tentation they go away:</hi> ſo may it alſo be ſaid of ſome that ſeeme to reioyce in the Lord, that for a while they ſeeme to reioyce in the Lord, euen as long ſo he ſhowreth downe the early and the latter raine vpon them, but in time of perſecution, trouble, and aduerſitie, they hang downe their heads, and murmure againſt the Lord. It ſeemeth that Sathan thought that <hi>Iob</hi> would haue beene ſuch an one, as appeareth by theſe words, where he ſaith vnto God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Doth he feare God for nought?</hi> And the ſame may be ſaid of reioycing, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on euery ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the works of his hands, and his ſubſtance is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the Land.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">11.</note> 
                     <hi>But ſtretch out now thy hand, and touch all that he hath, to ſee if he will not blaſpheme thee to thy face.</hi> But he was deceiued in <hi>Iob.</hi> Yet therein he bewrayed a diſeaſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with many ſonnes of men are much tainted, which are neuer knowne what they are vntill the Lord ſend them ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie; for we ſee many, that ſo long as they haue all things at their deſire, reioyce in the Lord; who ſo much as they? ſpecially, when their diſhes are full furniſhed, O then how well doth it like them, to confeſſe that he is good &amp; gracious, and bountifull! But if the Lord begin to handle them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what roughly, ſo that things fall not out to their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then their countenance is changed, and they take the matter ſore to heart. And if he proceed, and depriuing them of his bleſſings, afflict them in body or in goods, then they fal to murmure, and oftentimes to blaſphemies: which blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:599:464"/> albeit ſome of them vtter not with their mouthes, yet in their hearts repine they at the Lord, for ſuch his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon them. Now theſe in triall proue plainly to be hypocrites, and by triall it appeareth that their ioy is not Chriſtian, becauſe it is not conſtant, but ebbeth and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth according to the ebbe and floud of aduerſitie and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then? when the Lord afflicteth vs with pouertie, ſickeneſſe, and the like croſſes; muſt we reioyce in the Lord? Yea verily:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6.7.</note> for it is <hi>the Lord that killeth and maketh aliue,</hi> that <hi>woundeth and healeth,</hi> that <hi>bringeth to the graue, and raiſeth vp,</hi> that <hi>maketh poore, and maketh rich,</hi> that <hi>bringeth low, and exalteth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no euill in the Citie which the Lord hath not done:</hi> No euill, that is, no croſſe or affliction, no plague or puniſhment which he ſendeth not. And whatſoeuer croſſe or affliction it is, vnto his children it is but either a probation, that the triall of their faith, being much more precious then gold that periſheth, may be found to their praiſe, and honour, and glorie at the appearing of Ieſus Chriſt, ſuch as was <hi>Iobs</hi> affliction; or elſe, it is a fatherly correction, that being cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened of the Lord,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14.</note> they may not be condemned with the world; ſuch as was the death of <hi>Dauids</hi> child for <hi>Dauids</hi> ſin, and ſuch as was the weakeneſſe, and ſickeneſſe, and death of many of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 30.</note> for eating and drinking vnworthily at the Lords Table. Are then our croſſes of pouertie, ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or whatſoeuer they be, from God? Then are they good, and we are to reioyce in them. For all things fall out for the beſt, for thoſe that loue and feare him. Are they for the triall of our faith? <hi>My brethren,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iames,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>James</hi> 1.2.</note> 
                     <hi>count it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioy when ye fall into diuerſe tentations and trialls, &amp;c.</hi> Are they to correct and chaſtice vs? <hi>If we endure chaſtening,</hi>

                     <hi>God offereth himſelfe vnto vs as vnto ſonnes, for whom he loueth, he chaſteneth.</hi> O but ſometimes he ſhutteth vs euen vp in deſpaire and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie: how ſhall we then reioyce in the Lord? I demand then: Doſt thou know it, and lothe it, and long to be brought againe into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God? Thou haſt good cauſe to reioyce in the Lord, for he hath onely hid his face from thee for a while, that he may haue mercie on
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:599:465"/> thee for euer. And what if thy faith or hope be but as a graine of Muſtard ſeed? what if being as it were couered vnder the aſhes, they ſeeme not to be? Chriſt Ieſus is moſt plentifull, to helpe them that are moſt weake: and he is all-ſufficient, to ſupply all wants. If any ſeede of God be there, in thy weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he will perfite his praiſe. Yea, but in that our Sauiour pronounceth a bleſſing vpon them that mourne,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.4.</note> it appeareth that we are not alwayes to reioyce. Not ſo neyther, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then when we ſigh and mourne for the affliction we haue in the world, we are to reioyce in the Lord, and to be of good comfort in Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe he hath ouercome the world; euen then when we mourne through a ſence of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we are to reioyce in his tender mercies, that he deales not with vs after our deſeruings; euen then when we mourne in the body becauſe of affliction, we are to reioyce in our ſoules becauſe of our ſtrong conſolation in Chriſt Ieſus, and becauſe our light affliction in the body cauſeth vnto vs a far moſt excellent, and an eternall weight of glorie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour in the ſame place where he ſaith, Bleſſed are they that mourne, exhorteth alſo to reioyce and be glad in perſecution, for that great is our reward in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs to take heed how we murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, for pouertie, ſickeneſſe, or any croſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. They are from the Lord whatſoeuer they be, and if we be his children, they are onely eyther for the triall of our faith and patience, that patience hauing her perfect worke, we may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing; or elſe, as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing correction of a mercifull father, that we may be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the wickedneſſe of our wayes. And if we do not now reioyce in the Lord, when he ſeemeth thus to hide his face from vs, certainly, whatſoeuer ſhew we made before of reioycing in the Lord, we plaied but the hypocrites. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer therefore, looking vnto our ſelues, vnto our ſins, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our infirmities, vnto our afflictions, vnto the world we may ſigh and mourne, yet let vs reioyce in the Lord. We are not bid to reioyce in our ſelues: Nay, in our ſelues we ſhalbe ſure to haue cauſe enough of mourning. We muſt therefore go out of our ſelues vnto the Lord, and we muſt reioyce
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:599:465"/> in him. We muſt looke vnto him, and remember that he is good, and therefore whatſoeuer he doth is good; that he is Almightie, aod therefore can raiſe vs out of the duſt of death, and ſet vs with the Princes of the earth; that he is mercifull, and therefore will not ſuffer the rod of the vngodly to reſt on the lot of the righteous. And againe, we muſt remember that he was poore, that we might be made rich in him; that he was weake, that we might be made ſtrong in him; that he was tempted, that he might be able to ſuccour them which are tempted. What cauſe therefore ſoeuer of mourning there be in our ſelues, let vs looke out of our ſelues, and let vs reioyce in him alwayes. If he bleſſe vs, then we thinke and yeeld eaſily that we haue cauſe to reioyce in the Lord: and if he croſſe vs with any plague or trouble, then we haue alſo cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in him, becauſe it is for our good, and his owne glorie. Reioyce therefore in the Lord alwayes.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are (as we heard the laſt day) an exhortation vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>reioyce,</hi> not as the world doth, but to <hi>reioyce in the Lord;</hi> not with a momentanie and flitting ioy, but <hi>alwayes,</hi> both in weale and in woe; not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly made, or about a light and eaſie matter, but ſeriouſly made, and about a matter very needfull, and yet hard to be perſwaded, and therefore doubled, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I ſay, reioyce in the Lord alwayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſee how it pleaſeth the Lord, that as the Apoſtle comes againe and againe vnto this holy exhortation, and leaues it not with once or twice, but euen the third time alſo
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:599:466"/> exhorteth them to reioyce in the Lord; ſo I ſhould come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you againe and againe, euen three ſeuerall times with the ſame exhortation to reioyce in the Lord. <hi>Againe,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>I ſay reioyce, euen in the Lord alwayes,</hi> for that is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and reſumed to the former place. From which doubling and redoubling of this exhortation, I obſerue both how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and withall how hard a matter it is to perſwade this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reioycing in the Lord, to reioyce in the Lord alwayes. For to this end doth the holy Ghoſt often in the Scriptures vſe to double and redouble his ſpeech, euen to ſhew both the needfulnes of his ſpeech, and the difficultie in reſpect of man of enforcing his ſpeech. In the Pſalme, how often doth the Prophet exhort the faithful vnto the praiſes of the Lord, euen before all the people, that they &amp; their poſteritie might know them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.</note> ſaying, <hi>O that men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men!</hi> Euen foure ſeueral times in that one Pſalme. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? but to ſhew how needfull it was they ſhould do ſo, and how hardly men are drawne to do ſo. How often likewiſe doth our Sauiour exhort his diſciples vnto humilitie &amp; meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29.</note> ſometimes ſaying vnto them, <hi>Learne of me that I am meeke and lowly in heart;</hi> ſometimes telling them, that whoſoeuer among them would be great,<note place="margin">20.26.</note> ſhould be ſeruant vnto the reſt; ſometimes waſhing their feete,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.</note> &amp;c. thereby to teach them hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. And wherefore doth he ſo often beate vpon it, but to ſhew how needfull it was they ſhould be humble and meeke, and likewiſe how hard a thing it is to draw men vnto humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and meekneſſe? How often likewiſe doth the holy Ghoſt exhort to the putting off of the old man, and the putting on of the new man? No part of Scripture throughout the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wherein the holy Ghoſt doth not ſpeake much, though not haply in theſe words, yet to this purpoſe. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore elſe is it, but to imply both how needfull a matter it is to be perſwaded, and how hard a matter it is to perſwade the mortification of the old man, and the quickening of the new man? And to let other inſtances paſſe, in the point whereof we now ſpeake, how oft doth our Sauiour exhort to reioyce and be glad in perſecution,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12.</note> becauſe of the reward laid vp for vs by

                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.20.</note> to reioyce becauſe our names are written in heauen by the finger of Gods own hand;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.33.</note> to be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, becauſe he hath ouercome the world, that is, to reioyce in the Lord? And wherefore, but to ſhew how needfull it is to reioyce in the Lord, and how hard it is to perſwade this reioycing? So that by the vſuall courſe of the Scripture it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that our Apoſtle doubling and redoubling this his exhortation, thereby ſheweth both how needfull, and withall how hard a matter it is to perſwade this conſtant reioycing in the Lord, to reioyce in the Lord alwayes: ſo needfull, that it muſt be perſwaded again and again, and withall ſo hard to be perſwaded, that it cannot be too much vrged &amp; beaten vpon.</p>
                  <p>But it wil not be amiſſe yet a litle more particularly to looke into the reaſons why it is ſo needfull to reioyce in the Lord alwayes, and why we are ſo hardly perſwaded to reioyce in the Lord alwayes. Who ſeeth not, that conſidereth any thing, what mightie enemies we haue alwayes to fight withall, the fleſh within vs to ſnare and deceiue vs, the world without vs to fight and wage warre againſt vs, and the diuel euer ſeeking like a roaring Lion whom he may deuoure? Who ſeeth not, what fightings without, what terrors within, what anguiſhes in the ſoule, what griefes in the bodie, what perils abroade, what practiſes at home, what troubles we haue on euery ſide? When then Satan y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> old dragon caſts out many flouds of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions againſt vs, when wicked men cruelly, diſdainfully, and deſpitefully ſpeake againſt vs; when lying, ſlandering, and deceitfull mouthes are opened vpon vs; when we are mocked and ieſted at, and had in deriſion of all them that are about vs; when we are afflicted, tormented, and made the worlds won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; when the ſorrowes of death compaſſe vs, and the flouds of wickedneſſe make vs afraid, and the paines of hell come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto our ſoule: what is it that holds vp our heads that we ſinke not? how is it that we ſtand either not ſhaken, or if ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet not caſt downe? Is it not by our reioycing which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus? Yes verily: we lift vp our eyes vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and we are of good comfort, becauſe he hath ouercome the world; we lift vp our eyes vnto the Lord, and we reioyce in him, becauſe he ſhal giue a good end vnto all our troubles,
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:599:467"/> and ſhall wipe all teares from our eyes. In <hi>Dauids</hi> troubles, he was all his ſtay, as himſelfe euery where almoſt proteſteth; and when the Apoſtles were perſecuted, beaten, and caſt in priſon, they reioyced, becauſe of their ſtrong conſolation in Chriſt Ieſus. And ſo it is with all the faithfull children of God, whatſoeuer flouds do beate vpon them, whatſoeuer cauſes of ſorrow do ouertake them, yet do they ſtand and quaile not, becauſe of the reioycing they haue in Chriſt Ieſus. On this rocke all the ſurges of the ſea of this world are broken.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when others of vs are aſſaulted by that mightie Prince of darkneſſe, when we are tried by mockings &amp; ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, by bonds and impriſonment; when we feele the ſmart of loſſe, or hurt in bodie, goods or name; when the Beaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and with him that falſe Prophet of <hi>Rome</hi> thunder out threatnings, and imagine all kind of miſchiefe againſt vs; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paines of death take hold of vs, and multitude of ſorowes beſet vs round about, why is it that our hearts do faile within vs? how is it that we fall from our former loue, and that feare commeth vpon vs as vpon a woman in her trauell? Is it not through our want of reioycing in the Lord! Yes verily: we feele not in our ſoules the treaſures of mercies that are hid for vs in Chriſt Ieſus, which ſhould keepe vs ſtanding againſt all batteries and aſſaults whatſoeuer, and therefore we are not onely daunted and diſmayed with theſe things, but are quite affright and vtterly ouercome of them. If any one of <hi>Iobs</hi> afflictions lie vpon vs, we breake out into all the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies that he did, but we cannot lay hold of any ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts as he did. If death ſeize vpon ſonne or daughter, or any deare vnto vs,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam</hi> 18.33.</note> we breake out into like outcries with <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Abſalon my ſonne, my ſonne Abſalon, would God I had died for thee, O Abſalon my ſonne, my ſonne:</hi> but though <hi>Ioab</hi> would, yet can he not comfort vs as he did <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſt.</hi> 6.12.</note> If <hi>Haman</hi> do but feare the Kings diſpleaſure, he haſtes him home mourning, and couers his head, and will not be comforted: and if <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> do but ſee that his counſell be not followed,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.23.</note> he ſaddles his aſſe, and rides home, and hangs himſelfe. And this it is when men haue not their comfort in God, whatſoeuer do befall them in this life. If this or that thwart them, by and by
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:599:467"/> they are caſt downe. And why? euen becauſe they haue not learned to reioyce in the Lord alway. Very needfull then it is, ye ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we reioyce in the Lord alwayes, both becauſe by our reioycing which we haue in the Lord, we ſtand againſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer otherwiſe might quell vs; and becauſe through the want thereof, it is that wee fall and are vtterly ouercome whenſoeuer ſtormes ariſe, and troubles aſſault vs.</p>
                  <p>And as thus it may appeare how needfull a thing it is that we reioyce in the Lord alwayes, ſo it may eaſily alſo be ſeene how hardly we are perſwaded to reioyce in the Lord always. Euery man complaineth where his ſhoo pincheth him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man layes his hand vpon his ſore. But very few in ſuch caſes when the hand of the Lord is vpon them, when they are humbled and brought low through oppreſſion, through any pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gue or trouble, can be brought vnto this, to reioyce in the Lord. Nay tell one wicked and vngodly man when his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are multiplied, and when his ſorrowes are increaſed, that he is to know that the Lord his hand is in all theſe, that he is not to murmure againſt the Lord, but to reioyce in the Lord; doth he not ſay of them that thus ſpeake vnto him, that they are mad? doth he not with indignation aske, what cauſe he hath to reioyce in the Lord? doth he not ſtil crie out vpon his croſſes, and miſeries, and vexations, and paines? and doth he not within a while belch out moſt impious blaſphemies? And hence it is that many with <hi>Iudas</hi> in ſuch caſes fall to deſpaire, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> and ſaying, <hi>Let the day periſh wherein I was borne, and the night wherein it was ſaid. There is a man child conceiued, &amp;c.</hi> And thus it fareth often with the deare children of God, that they ſinke ſo farre, that their ſoule almoſt refuſeth comfort in the Lord. Their ſenſe and feeling of their paine and affliction, is ſometimes ſo great, that they haue almoſt no ſenſe or feeling of God. Which yet I do not ſo ſpeak, as if the children of God might not be touched with ſorrow and heauineſſe for the croſſes of this life: for no doubt they may; but to ſhew that ſometimes they are ſo caſt downe with heauineſſe, that it is a hard matter to reare them vp againe. For as <hi>Iobs</hi> friends diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted againſt him, ſo they againſt themſelues, that they are puniſhed of God for their ſins and iniquities, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now he hath ſhut vp his louing kindneſſe in diſpleaſure. And then they ſtand prying and looking into their ſinnes, and hardly can they be drawne to lift vp their eyes vnto the Lord, that in him they may find comfort vnto their ſoules. I wil not ſtand vpon the further enlarging of this point. By this which hath bene ſpoken, ye ſee how needful it is we ſhould reioyce in the Lord alwaies, and withall how hardly we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to reioyce in the Lord alwaies, and conſequently vpon what cauſe the Apoſtle doubled and redoubled this his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</p>
                  <p>Now this may firſt inſtruct vs in the merciful goodneſſe of our God towards vs, who in things ſo needfull for vs, and whereunto we are ſo hardly drawne, ceaſſeth not to ſtirre vp our dull minds, and againe and againe to call them to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.10.</note>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> beate it into vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly this may teach vs our dulneſſe to conceiue, and ſlackneſſe to embrace the things that belong vnto our peace. Such things muſt be doubled and redoubled vnto vs, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="771" facs="tcp:599:468"/> we will not learne them; they muſt be often vrged, and much beaten vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet we wil not receiue inſtruction. The Lord muſt euen draw vs vnto himſelfe by his holy Spirit, and yet we will not runne after him; he muſt ſend his holy Prophets and Miniſters vnto vs early and late, and all litle enough to ſtirre vp our dull minds.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this may teach vs to hold faſt that reioycing which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus. For is it ſo, that the holy Apoſtle doth ſo often exhort vs to reioyce in the Lord alwaies; is it ſo, that it is ſo needful for vs to reioyce in the Lord alwaies, that only by our reioycing in him, we ſtand faſt againſt whatſoeuer troubles and ſorrowes; and without it, we are quite affright and vtterly ouercome of them; is it ſo, that we are ſo hardly drawne to reioyce in the Lord alwaies? How are we then to hold faſt that reioycing which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus, euen ſo faſt, that nothing take it from vs? Let vs therefore reioyce, but let vs reioyce in the Lord, &amp; let vs reioyce in him alwaies, that ſo no man, nay that nothing take from vs our reioycing in him. <hi>A ioyfull heart maketh a cheerfull countenance,</hi> and if the heart be ioyful in the Lord, it cheeres the heart and quickens the ſoule, howſoeuer the countenance be appalled. Other ioyes in riches, in honours, in friends, in the vanities of this life, and in the pleaſures of ſinne, haply haue their moment of time, and their appearance of good: but their time is but only a moment, and their good but onely an appearance and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſemblance: onely the reioycing in the Lord, is the true and ſound reioycing, and which cauſeth good health vnto the ſoule. Let vs therefore reioyce in the Lord, and let vs reioyce in him alwaies, not onely when he feedeth vs with the floure of wheate, but when he giueth vs plenteouſneſſe of teares to drink. For whether he bleſſe vs or croſſe vs, it is for our good, and his glorie, and therfore he is to be bleſſed in both. Yea, &amp; whatſoeuer croſſes or ſorows we ſuffer, let that remembrance of Chriſt his bleſſed death and paſſion which this day we cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, be ſufficient to cauſe vs to reioyce in the Lord. For what are all our ſufferings or ſorrowes vnto thoſe benefits of Chriſt his death and paſſion, whereof this day may put vs in mind, &amp; which this day ſhall be ſealed vnto the ſoules of thoſe which
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:599:469"/> are worthie communicants in this holy Supper? For when this is ſealed vnto our ſoules in this holy Supper, that Chriſt died for vs, that by his bloud we receiue remiſſion of our ſins, that we are incorporated into his myſticall bodie, and made one with him and he with vs; that he hath obtained eternall redemption for vs, and that in Chriſt are treaſured vp for vs all the benefites of our ſaluation, euen as ſurely as we are ſure of the bread and wine which we receiue into our bodies at this Supper; what ſorrowes for any croſſes ſhould ſo far ſinke vs, but that we ſhould recouer our ſelues by our reioycing which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus? For though hell it ſelfe ſhould open her mouth vpon vs, though ſorrow it ſelfe ſhould ſeeke to ſwallow vs vp quick, yet ſtil here is matter enough wherein to reioyce. Reioyce therefore in the Lord alway, againe I ſay, reioyce. Thus much of this exhortation. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let your patient mind, &amp;c.</hi> This is alſo an exhortation vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> wherein the Apoſtle exhorteth them not only to ſuch a patience as is tried and ſeene in bearing iniuries and putting vp wrongs, but generally vnto ſuch a moderate, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, eaſie, and gentle behauiour towards their neighbours and brethren, as that they will rather loſe of their right, then not liue in peace and vnitie with them. For ſo the word here vſed ſignifieth, namely a moderation of that by equitie, which in rigour might be exacted. The word is ſometimes tranſlated as if we ſhould reade thus in this place, <hi>Let your curteous mind, &amp;c.</hi> as in the Acts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 24.4.</note> where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith vnto <hi>Felix, I pray thee that thou wouldeſt heare vs of thy curteſie a few words.</hi> And in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Seruants be ſubiect to your maiſters with all feare,</hi>

                     <hi>not onely to the good and curteous, but alſo to the froward.</hi> Sometimes it is tranſlated as if we ſhould thus reade, <hi>Let your gentle mind, &amp;c.</hi> as in the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.</note> 
                     <hi>I beſeech you by the meekneſſe and gentleneſſe of Chriſt;</hi> and in the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> where it is ſaid that <hi>a Biſhop muſt not be giuen to filthy lucre,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.</note> 
                     <hi>but gentle.</hi> And ſometimes againe it is tranſlated, as if we ſhould thus reade, <hi>Let your ſoft mind, &amp;c.</hi> as in the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> where he willeth <hi>Titus</hi> to put his people in mind <hi>that they be no fighters,</hi>

                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2.</note> 
                     <hi>but ſoft, ſhewing all meekneſſe to all men.</hi> But it comes all to one, whether we reade,
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:599:469"/> Let your patient, or your curteous, or your gentle, or your ſoft minde be knowne vnto all men. The thing which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them vnto, is ſuch a mildeneſſe of their behauiour, and moderation of their affections among their neighbours and brethren, as that, for vnities ſake, they will rather loſe of their owne, then ſtrictly ſtand vpon their right in matters of this life. And this their mildeneſſe and moderation among their neighbours, he would haue ſo notorious and euident, that it might be knowne, and that to all men; not for matter of oſtentation and vaine-glorie amongſt men, but that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out this light to all men in their liues, they may be won vnto the faith of Chriſt, and the Name of God may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And becauſe the <hi>Philippians</hi> might haply thus obiect and ſay: Yea indeed, muſt we put vp iniuries, muſt we not ſtand vpon our right, but ſometimes yeeld of our right; then ſhall we make a hand indeede, and quickly be the meaneſt among men, and be trampled vnder feete, as the clay in the ſtreets. Therefore the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>The Lord is at hand;</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid: Though they do abuſe your patient milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and gentle moderation of your affections, yet do ye hold on this good courſe, and poſſeſſe your ſoules in patience. For <hi>the Lord is at hand,</hi> euen neare, to auenge you of your wrongs, and to repay you with glorie. So that here we haue an exhortation, and a reaſon. The exhortation is to bring them to a gentle moderation of their affections towards their brethren in matters of ordinary life. The reaſon is, to preuent an obiection. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we ſee the meaning of the words, and the ſpeciall points, together with the purpoſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle therein, let vs further ſee what we may obſerue hence for our owne vſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which I note in the exhortation is, that the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> to a gentle moderation of their affections towards their brethren in matters of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life, ſo that for the keeping of vnity ſometimes they yeeld of their right. Whence I obſerue a neceſſarie rule for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to be kept for euer in all their dealings with their neighbors, which is, in matters of ordinarie life, to vſe ſuch moderation of their affections, as that, for vnities ſake, they
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:599:470"/> do not alwayes ſtrictly ſtand vpon their right, but ſometimes yeeld of their right, and ſit them downe with the loſſe, and patiently put vp the wrong. A notable patterne of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of this rule we haue in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who in the ſtrife that was betweene his heard-men and <hi>Lots</hi> heard-men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſis</hi> 13.8.</note> and was like to be betweene him and <hi>Lot,</hi> reſigned his owne right to buy peace,<note place="margin">9.</note> ſaying vnto <hi>Lot, I pray thee let there be no ſtrife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and me, nor betweene mine heard-men and thine heard-men; for we be brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? depart I pray thee from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right: or if thou go to the right hand, then I wil go to the left.</hi> He was <hi>Lots</hi> elder, and his vncle, and euerie way his better, yet he ſtood not vpon theſe points, looking when <hi>Lot</hi> ſhould come vnto him, and ſtoupe to him, but in great mildneſſe and patience he ſo moderates his affections, as that he goes vnto him, and moues the peace, and yeelds his owne right to haue it. Another patterne hereof we haue figured in that Parable in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.24 27.</note> in the example of the King, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his ſeruants to an account, and finding one that owed him ten thouſand talents, but had nothing to pay, forgaue him his debt. He ſtood not vpon it, that ſo much he owed, and ſo much he ſhould pay, or elſe his body ſhould rot in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; but finding him poore, and not able to pay, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his right, and forgaue him the debt. And thus ſhould we do in matters of ordinarie life, and ciuill dealing one with another, we ſhould be kind and curteous one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhewing all meekenes and mildeneſſe one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we muſt not ſtand vpon termes one with another, but we muſt yeeld one vnto another; we muſt ſuſtaine ſome loſſe one at anothers hands, we muſt put vp ſome wrongs one at anothers hands. I ſay in matters of ordinarie life, and ciuill dealing one with another. For in matters of faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in matters belonging vnto God, there we muſt not yeeld an inch to any aduerſarie of the truth, to turne any whit from the rule of the Word, either to the right hand, or to the left. Heere we muſt be at ſtrife as <hi>Moſes</hi> was with <hi>Pharao,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.28.</note> when he told him that they would haue all their cattell with them, and that they would not leaue an hoofe behinde them. For
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:599:470"/> here to yeeld a whit, is to quench that zeale which ought to be in vs towards the glorie of our God. But in matters of common life, there we ſhould yeeld, and rather ſuſtaine loſſe and wrong, then nouriſh iarres and quarrels.</p>
                  <p>But what is our practiſe? Ye know that in the parable of the ſeruant that had all his debt forgiuen him, how meeting with his fellow that owed him an hundred pence, he layd hands on him, and tooke him by the throate, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Pay me that thou oweſt;</hi> and when he could not, he caſt him into priſon till he ſhould pay the debt. So we, if we thinke that we haue right on our ſide, we ſtand vpon it: and what? who is he? ſhal we yeeld of our right? ſo we may be counted fooles indeed. Shall we ſit downe with the loſſe? Nay, we will haue it if he haue it out of his belly. Shall we put vp ſuch a wrong? Nay then let them abuſe me at their pleaſures. We are as good as they, we are their betters euery way; or though we be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then they, yet ſhall they not thinke to haue vs vnder their girdles? we may not, we cannot, we will not ſuffer theſe and theſe things. This is our practiſe, quite contrary to the rule before mentioned, and to thoſe good patterns before propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. We make a ieaſt of that of our Sauiour, where he ſayth, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall ſmite thee on thy right cheeke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.39.</note> 
                     <hi>turne to him the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo:</hi> and we ſay, whoſoeuer giues me a blow, he ſhal haue two for it, or at leaſt, he ſhall haue as good as he brings. So farre are we from that minde to ſuſtaine any loſſe, or to put vp any wrong. And hereupon it is that we are ſo vnpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one with another, and ſo vncharitable one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hereupon it is that there are ſuch hart-burnings, grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, iarres, debates, contentions, and diuiſions amongſt vs. Well, will we mend that which is amiſſe, and put in practiſe the rule that hath bene giuen vnto vs? Let vs then obſerue theſe rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hath our neighbour or brother ſome faults that are rather naturall, then puniſhable by the lawes; as for example, is he ſomewhat proud, ſomewhat couetous, ſomewhat ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and angry, ſomewhat ſuperſtitious? &amp;c. Let vs learne to skill of his nature, &amp; beare with it: Secondly, ſuch words and deeds as haply might haue not the beſt conſtruction, let vs
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:599:471"/> make the beſt of them. Thirdly, ſuch faults as are ſecret, or committed by infirmitie, let vs not publiſh, but hide and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them. Fourthly, if his fault be greater, and ſuch as iuſtly may offend vs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15.</note> let vs go vnto him, and tell him his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and vs alone; if he heare vs, we haue won him: if he heare vs not, then let vs call vnto vs one or two, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our whole griefes before them, that by their meanes that which is amiſſe may be amended.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are, as we heard the laſt day, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exhortation vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> wherein the Apoſtle exhorteth them, not onely to ſuch a patience as is tried and ſeene in bearing iniuries and putting vp wrongs, but generally to ſuch mildeneſſe in their behauiour, and moderation of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions amongſt their neighbours and brethren, as that for v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſake they will rather loſe of their owne, then ſtrictly ſtand vpon their right in matters of ordinarie life: for ſo the word here vſed by the Apoſtle ſignifieth, namely a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that by equitie, which in rigour might be exacted. Now this their mildeneſſe and moderation among their bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren the Apoſtle would haue ſo conſpicuous and euident, as that it might be knowne, and that to all men; not for matter of oſtentation and vaine-glory amongſt men, but both that all men, as occaſions were offered, might haue triall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in them; and that amongſt all men religion might thereby be increaſed, and the Name of God glorified: <hi>Let your &amp;c.</hi> That which followeth, <hi>The Lord is at hand,</hi> is a reaſon of the exhortation, added by the Apoſtle, to preuent an obiection: for, the drift of the Apoſtles exhortation vnto them, aiming
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:599:471"/> at this, that there ſhould be ſuch moderation in them, as that they ſhould not alwayes ſtand vpon their right, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times yeeld of their right, and patiently put vp the loſſe or the wrong; they might haply thus obiect and ſay, So ſhould we make a hand indeed, and quickly be the meaneſt among men, and be trampled vnder feet as the clay in the ſtreetes. Therefore the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>The Lord is at hand;</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, Though they do abuſe your patient milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and gentle moderation of your affections, yet do ye hold on a good courſe, in patience poſſeſſe your ſoules, and let your patient mind be knowne to all men: for the Lord is at hand, euen neare to aide and helpe you, to auenge you of your wrongs, and to repay you with glorie in the Kingdome of glorie.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which I noted in the exhortation was, that the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> to a gentle moderation of their affections towards their brethren in matters of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie life, ſo that for the keeping of vnitie ſometimes they yeeld of their right. Whence I obſerued a neceſſarie rule for all Chriſtians to be kept for euer in all their dealings with their neighbours; which is, in matters of ordinarie life to vſe ſuch moderation of their affections, as that for vnities ſake, they do not alwayes ſtrictly ſtand vpon their right, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times yeeld of their right, and ſit them downe with the loſſe, and patiently put vp the wrong. Two notable patterns I ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed you of the practiſe of this rule: the one in <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſis</hi> 13.</note> who being <hi>Lots</hi> elder, and vncle, and his better euerie way, ſtood not vpon theſe points, but went vnto him, and moued the peace betweene them, and yeelded his owne right to haue it: the other in the king in the Goſpell, who finding his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant poore, and not able to pay the debt he owed him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</note> remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his right, and forgaue him his debt. Whoſe examples we ought to follow in matters of ordinarie life and ciuill dealing one with another, not ſtanding vpon termes one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yeelding one vnto another, ſhewing all meekneſſe and mildenes one towards another, and putting vp ſome loſſe and ſome wrong one at anothers hands. But how quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary our practiſe is to this rule, and to theſe good patterns I
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:599:472"/> ſhewed you. For if we thinke that we haue right, then we ſtand vpon it, and thus we ſay with our ſelues: Shall we yeeld of our right? ſo we may be begged for fooles indeed. Shall we ſit downe with the loſſe? Nay, we will haue it if he haue it out of his belly. Shall we put vp ſuch a wrong? Nay, then let them abuſe vs at their pleaſures. We are as good as they, or, we are their betters euerie way; or, though we be meaner then they, yet ſhall they not thinke to haue vs vnder their girdles; we may not, we cannot, we will not ſuffer theſe and theſe things. And hereupon, to go now forward in the point, hereupon, I ſay, it is that we are ſo vnpeaceable one with another, and ſo vncharitable one towards another: hereupon it is that there are ſuch heart-burnings, grudgings, iarres, debates, contentions, and diuiſions amongſt vs: we cannot be gentle, and curteous, and kinde one vnto another: we cannot yeeld one vnto another, or beare one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: we cannot put vp any loſſe or wrong one at anothers hands. The ſuperiour he diſdaines to yeeld in any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his inferiour, and he thinks it is a diſparagement vnto him. The inferiour he is loath to yeeld in any thing vnto his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and he thinkes that if he yeeld an inch, the other will take an elle; if he yeeld in any thing, the other will crow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him in all things. The equall, he cannot brook it to yeeld vnto his equall, and he thinkes it is a debaſing and diſgracing of himſelfe, to put vp any thing at his hands that is no better then himſelfe. Thus in ſuperiour, inferiour, and equall, is wanting that patient, gentle, curteous, and ſoft mind where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our Apoſtle exhorteth; and in ſtead of meekenes, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes, patience, moderation, and mildneſſe one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, are entertained murmurings, reaſonings, heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and vnſeemely ſpeaking and dealing one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is vtterly a fault amongſt vs. Will we then mend that which is amiſſe, and put in practiſe the rule that hath bin giuen vs, vſing in matters of ordinarie life, ſuch moderation of our affections amongſt our neighbours and brethren, as that for vnities ſake we will paſſe by many faults and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſometimes yeeld of our right, and ſit vs downe with the loſſe, &amp; put vp the wrong? I am ſure we ſhould; and if we
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:599:472"/> will do ſo, we muſt obſerue theſe rules that follow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hath our neighbour or brother ſome faults that are rather naturall then puniſhable by the lawes, as for example, is he ſome what proud, ſomewhat couetous, ſomewhat haſtie and angrie, ſomewhat vnſociable, ſomewhat ſuſpicious? &amp;c. we muſt in ſuch caſes deale with him as <hi>Dauid</hi> did with his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt brother <hi>Eliab.</hi> When <hi>Dauid</hi> being ſent of his father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his brethren to the battell, had ſhewed his miſlike, that none would vndertake to fight with <hi>Goliah, Eliab</hi> was verie angry with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Why cameſt thou downe hither?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28.</note> 
                     <hi>and with whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheepe in the wildernes? I know thy pride and malice of thine heart, that thou art come downe to ſee the battell.</hi> Now what was <hi>Dauids</hi> reply vnto theſe ſharpe ſpeeches of his brother? He knew his brethrens ſtomacke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and therefore onely ſaid, <hi>What haue I now done?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">29.</note> 
                     <hi>is there not a cauſe?</hi> and ſo departed. So we ſhould learne to skil of the nature of them with whom we liue, and we ſhould beare much with ſuch faults as theſe. To quit their pride with diſdaine, if they be proud; to be euer telling them of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, if they be couetous; to put fewell vnto the fire by miniſtring occaſions of anger, if they be haſtie and angrie; to increaſe their iealouſie by any prepoſterous dealing, if they be ſome what ſuſpicious, is no way for vs to cure their faults, or to liue with them in that Chriſtian ſort we ſhould. This is that which behooueth vs, if we will haue our patient mindes knowne, we muſt beare with theſe and ſuch like faults in our neighbours and brethren, and ſpare oftentimes to ſpeake or do that which their humour cannot brooke.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond rule which we muſt obſerue is this; ſuch words and deeds as haply ſometimes might haue not the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or meaning, we muſt make the beſt of them: for if when things are ſaid or done which might be well meant, and well taken, they be worſe taken then they are meant, and rather the worſt then the beſt be made of them; ſhall we ſay of thoſe men, that they are patiently and gently minded? nay ſurely, this is rather an argument of an exaſperate minde, which had rather blow the bellowes, then quench the fire, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make a breach where there were none, then make vp a
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:599:473"/> breach where there were one. And therefore the Apoſtle put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſuch as <hi>take all things in the euill part,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29.</note> in the ranke of them whom God had deliuered vp vnto a reprobate mind. If then we will haue our patient mind knowne, and be commended for that moderation which our Apoſtle here requireth, we muſt not interprete ſuch things as are ſaid or done, vnto the worſt, but when they may haue a good meaning, we muſt make the beſt of them: for ſo indeed do we ſhew our ſelues to haue a good moderation in our ſelues, if when things in themſelues are eyther doubtfull, or not altogether the beſt, yet we make the beſt of them, and rather ſo conſtrue them as they ought to be meant, then as they might be taken.</p>
                  <p>A third rule which we muſt obſerue is this: Such faults as are ſecret, or committed by infirmitie, we muſt not diuulgate and publiſh, but rather hide and couer them. It is the ſaying of our bleſſed Sauiour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Whatſoeuer ye would that men ſhould do to you, euen ſo do ye to them:</hi> and it implieth this withall, that whatſoeuer we would not that men ſhould do to vs, we ſhould not do to them. Now then, who is it of vs, that if we fall through infirmitie, if we runne into any ſecret ſin, would haue it publiſhed in <hi>Gath,</hi> or noyſed in the ſtreetes of <hi>Aſhke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iames</hi> 3.2.</note> 
                     <hi>In many things we ſinne all:</hi> and he is the beſt that offends the leaſt. But who can brooke him, that whatſoeuer fault he heares in the houſe, by and by tells it on the houſe tops? or how ſhall he approue his moderation, and his patient minde vnto men, that whatſoeuer fault he knowes of his neighbor or brother, diſperſeth it abroad and makes it his common talke where he cometh? Nay, herein is our moderation and mildenes ſeene and approued, if when we know any ſlip or fall of our neighbour, which haply many know not, we pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently paſſe by it, and ſo beare it, that as much as in vs lies, we burie it out of the ſight and ſpeech of men. For as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of loue,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8.</note> that it couereth the multitude of ſinnes; ſo it is true in this moderation and patience whereof we ſpeake, that it beares with and pardoneth many faults and offences of one man towards another, &amp; likewiſe concealeth ſuch faults and offences as ſecretly or through infirmitie are committed againſt God. If then we will approue our ſelues to haue that
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:599:473"/> patient mind which our Apoſtle here requireth, we muſt not publiſh whatſoeuer fault of our neighbor we he are or know; but ſuch faults as either are not commonly knowne abroade, or whereinto he hath fallen through infirmitie, we muſt hide and couer them, and ſo beare with them, as to burie them out of the ſight and ſpeech of men.</p>
                  <p>A fourth rule which we muſt obſerue, is this: when the faults of our neighbour are ſuch as that they may iuſtly offend vs, behouefull it is that we go vnto him, and tel him his fault betweene him and vs alone; and if thus he hearken not vnto vs, then to call vnto vs one or two moe, that his fault being here opened againe, that which is amiſſe may be amended, and he in the beſt ſort that may be, may be reclaimed. Which rule is alſo the rule of our bleſſed Sauiour touching priuate iniuries and wrongs, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15.</note> 
                     <hi>If thy brother trespaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee,</hi> he ſpeaketh of priuate treſpaſſes and wrongs: for ſuch as are publike, and to the offence of the Church,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20.</note> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would haue them rebuked openly; but if thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee priuately, giuing thee cauſe of offence, go and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone: if he heare thee, thou haſt wonne thy brother, and as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>haſt ſaued a ſoule from death;</hi> and he repenting,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.20.</note> thou art to forgiue him, as Chriſt in another place warneth: and if he will not vouchſafe to heare thee,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 17.3.</note> to be ſorie for his fault at thy priuate admonition, but rather increaſe his ſtomack and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnneſſe againſt thee, then take yet with thee one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witneſſes, euery word may be confirmed. Otherwiſe if neglecting this rule of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, we ſhall vpon ſuch occaſions traduce him, or breake out into intemperate heates againſt him, how ſhall our patient mind be knowne vnto men? For this is our patience and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that when we haue ſo iuſt cauſe of offence, we deale as mildly and quietly with our neighbour as may be; firſt, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately conferring of things b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tweene our ſelues, and then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto vs one or two of our neighbours and friends which may heare, and helpe to order things that are out of order. And if we will approue our ſelues to haue that patient mind which here our Apoſtle requireth, we muſt thus peaceably
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:599:474"/> deale in matters wherein we haue iuſt cauſe of offence, and in no ſort traduce our neighbours or brethren, or breake out into impatient heates againſt them.</p>
                  <p>A fift rule which we muſt obſerue, and the laſt which now I will note, is this; generally in matters of this life we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of that which in rigor might be done. For if we ſhall thus ſtand vpon it, that this we may do by right, and this the law will beare vs out vnto, what proofe hereby ſhall we make of our moderation and patient mind?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.</note> The law ſaith, <hi>Who ſo ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed.</hi> Now who will commend the moderation of that Iudge, that ſo oft as bloud is ſhed, pronounceth ſentence of death, becauſe in rigour of the words it may ſeem he may do that, which indeed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the law he may not? And ſo it fareth with vs, if in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this or that qualitie betwixt vs and our neighbours, we ſhall alwaies do that which in extremitie of right it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that we may, and not moderate right by equitie, who ſhall commend our moderation? If we haue the loſſe, we muſt ſometimes ſuſtaine it; if we haue the wrong, we muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put it vp, and for peace and vnities ſake we muſt remit and yeeld of our right, if we wil haue our moderation and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient mind to be knowne. Moe rules might be added vnto theſe, but let theſe for this time ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>And now I beſeech you to thinke on theſe things, and in your liues one with another to practiſe them, that ſo your moderate, and curteous, and ſoft, and gentle, and patient mind may be knowne. Beare one with another in ſuch faults as are naturally in any of you, and ſpare ſometimes to ſpeake or do that which anothers humor cannot brooke: make not alwaies the worſt of ſuch words or deeds, as haply might haue not the beſt conſtruction and meaning, but rather when in themſelues they are either doubtfull, or not altogether the beſt, make the beſt of them, and ſo conſtrue them, as they may be wel meant rather then as they might be il taken. Be not haſtie to publiſh whatſoeuer fault of your neighbour you heare or know, but ſuch faults as either are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly known abroad, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he hath fallen through infirmitie, hide &amp; couer them, &amp; as much as in you is, burie them out of the ſight and ſpeech of
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:599:474"/> men. Traduce not one another, nor breake out into inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate heates one againſt another, but in matters wherein ye may haue iuſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of offence one againſt another, firſt priuately expoſtulate your matters one with another; and if amends do not follow, debate your matters one with another, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of one or two of your neighbours and friends, which may heare and helpe to order your matters. Be not auerſe from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe ſometimes with the loſſe, and from putting vp ſometimes the wrong, but for the maintenance of peace and concord one with another, remit and yeeld one vnto another, that which in right ſometimes ye might haue one of another, that ſo your patient mind may be knowne vnto all.</p>
                  <p>And why ſhould I need in many words at this time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you vnto this moderation one towards another? May not this day, may not that holy table ſufficiently exhort you here unto? For vnleſſe ye be patiently minded one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, can ye either worthily celebrate thoſe holy myſteries of Chriſt his bleſſed death and paſſion, or thankfully celebrate this day in remembrance of his reſurrection? To celebrate theſe holy myſteries worthily, is not to come hither as to an ordinary table, and here to eate and drink; but to come hither prepared with all holy reuerence, hauing examined our ſelues before as touching our faith in Chriſt Ieſus, whether by faith in Chriſt Ieſus we feele a full aſſurance in our ſoules of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and of all other benefites of Chriſt his death and paſſion, which in this Supper we deſire for our further aſſurance to be ſealed vnto vs; and touching our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whether we be truly grieued in our ſoules for our ſinnes againſt our God, and fully purpoſe hereafter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues vnto the will of God ſet downe in his word: as touching, I ſay, our faith and repentance, ſo touching our loue, whether we loue one another, ſo that as members of the ſame bodie, we beare one with another, and helpe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as faith and repentance towards God, ſo this loue alſo towards our neighbour is ſo neceſſarily requiſite, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we do not worthily celebrate theſe holy myſteries. And therefore if we will be worthie partakers of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper, as here we that are many, do all eate one bread,
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:599:475"/> and drinke of one cup, are all confirmed in one faith, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed to grow vp into one bodie, whereof Chriſt is the head; ſo muſt we loue one another, and as members of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, beare one with another, and helpe one another. So that at this time the verie celebration of theſe holy myſteries, may ſufficiently put vs in mind of that moderation &amp; patient mind which ought to be in one of vs towards another. Neither that onely, but this day alſo, wherein we celebrate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt his bleſſed reſurrection, may ſufficiently put vs in mind hereof. For hath Chriſt looſed the bands of death, and by his reſurrection from the dead, triumphed ouer death, and mightily declared himſelfe to be the Sonne of God? Yes he hath, and this day we celebrate the moſt ioyfull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof. And how ſhould not thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ection from the death of ſin vnto the life of God, thereby alſo we are put in mind of that moderation and patient mind which ought to be in one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another: let therefore the celebration of thoſe holy myſteries of Chriſt his death and paſſion, let the memoriall of his bleſſed reſurrection as on this day, be ſufficient to ſtirre you vp vnto this moderation which our Apoſtle here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and whereof hitherto we haue ſpoken. And whoſoeuer findeth himſelfe to haue failed herein heretofore, let him giue all diligence hereafter that his patient mind may be knowne vnto all men.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note in this exhortation, is this, that the Apoſtle would haue this their moderation and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo conſpicuous and euident, as that it might be knowne, and that to all men: no doubt to this end, that all men, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions were offered, might haue triall of their moderation and mildneſſe, and that thereby religion among all men might be increaſed, and the name of God, in whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, glorified. Whence I obſerue the extent of the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and mildneſſe that ought to be in vs, how farre the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:599:475"/> thereof is to reach, that they may haue triall and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof; namely, not to them alone that vſe vs kindly and gently, or to them alone which are within, but to them alſo which are without, euen vnto all men is our patient mind to be made knowne. For as our Sauiour ſaith in ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother matter, <hi>If ye loue them which loue you, what reward ſhall ye haue? and if ye be friendly to your brethren onely,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 5.46.47.</note> 
                     <hi>what ſingular thing do ye?</hi> So may it well be ſaid in this matter, if our patient mind be onely knowne vnto them that vſe vs with all mildnes and gentleneſſe, what ſingular thing do we? and if we mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our affections, and yeeld onely vnto them that yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, what praiſe ſhall we haue? Our moderation then and patient mind is not to be reſtrained in the vſe thereof vnto theſe and theſe men, but it is to be ſhewne vnto all men with whom we liue, be they better or worſe. So the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of charitable beneficence,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Let vs do good</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>while we haue time vnto all men.</hi> And againe, <hi>Haue peace with all men.</hi> And generally the precept is, that we haue our conuerſation honeſt amongſt all men. As lights therefore (for ſo we are called) we muſt communicate the light that is in vs vnto all men, holding forth our lights of gentleneſſe, goodnes, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, temperancie, moderation, patience, &amp;c. vnto all men: imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating therein our Father which is in heauen,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 5.45.</note> who <hi>maketh his Sunne to ariſe on the euill and on the good, and ſendeth raine on the iuſt and vniuſt.</hi> And now why are we to vſe this moderation towards all men, that our patient mind may be knowne vnto all men? The reaſon is, that all men ſeeing our moderation and mildneſſe towards all men, may thinke the better of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which we profeſſe, and the rather glorifie the Lord of glorie, in whom we beleeue. For if they ſhall ſee vnto wardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vnkindneſſe in one of vs towards another, quickly do they ſpeake euill of the name of God, and of the doctrine which we teach. And therefore the Apoſtle alwayes exhorts all ſorts vnto all holy duties: and why? <hi>that the name of God and his doctrine be not euill ſpoken of:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Iam</hi> 2 7.</note> 
                     <hi>that the word of God be not euill ſpoken of:</hi> that <hi>the worthy Name, after which they be named, be not blaſphemed.</hi> But if they ſhall ſee moderation and mildneſſe, meekneſſe, gentleneſſe and patience in one of vs towards an
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:599:476"/> other, we cannot better draw men vnto the glory of our God, and to a good opinion of our religion, and of the truth which we profeſſe. And in this reſpect it is that our bleſſed Sauiour thus exhorteth all men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16.</note> ſaying, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.</hi> And in the ſame reſpect alſo it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth, ſaying, <hi>Haue your conuerſation honeſt among the Gentiles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>that they which ſpeake euill of you as of euill doers, may by your good workes which they ſhall ſee, glorifie God in the day of the viſitation.</hi> For an ornament then of the truth which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and for the glorie of our God in whom we beleeue, our patient mind is to be made knowne vnto all men, not to our brethren onely, or ſuch as vſe vs kindly, but euen to all men.</p>
                  <p>Here then firſt were to be reproued thoſe braules and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels which fall out amongſt neighbours and brethren about matters of two pence, matters of nothing. Our Apoſtle would haue our moderation and patient mind knowne vnto all men. How is it then that neighbours and brethren will not one yeeld vnto another, wil not one beare with another? One wil haue his right, and not yeeld a iote; another will auenge his wrong, or elſe he will die for it; a third will beare coles at no mans hands, but ſuch as he brewes ſuch ſhall he drinke, and this amongſt neighbours and brethren. And how ſhall it be thought, that we will vſe moderation towards all men, while ſuch is our behauiour towards our neighbours and brethren? Whileſt it is thus among our ſelues, we ſhew plainly how litle heed we haue taken vnto this exhortation of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; conſequently how litle care we take, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God, and the truth which we profeſſe, be not euill ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here were to be reproued ſuch carnall excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are commonly taken againſt this exhortation. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Let your patient mind be knowne vnto all men.</hi> Vnto all men, ſay we: this is an hard ſaying. Vnto ſuch as vſe vs kindly and curteouſly, great reaſon that our patient mind ſhould be knowne: but vnto them that be euer readie to thwart and croſſe vs, to wrong and grieue vs, to taunt and mocke vs, to reuile and ſpeake euill of vs, what reaſon that our patient mind ſhould be knowne? Thus will we rather
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:599:476"/> teach the holy Ghoſt what to ſpeake, then we will be taught by the holy Ghoſt what to do. But ſuch exceptions we muſt take heed of, if we will ſuffer our ſelues to be taught by the ho holy Ghoſt, and as our Apoſtle willeth, we muſt let our patient mind be knowne vnto all men without ſuch exception of any.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence we learne what we are to reſpect in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of euery Chriſtian vertue, namely the glorie of God, and the propagation of his truth. For as our Sauior ſaith of almes, prayer, faſting, and the like,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 6.</note> that if they be done for the praiſe of men, then they haue their praiſe, but not with God; ſo may it be ſaid of the practiſe of euery Chriſtian vertue, that if therein we reſpect the praiſe of men, we haue our praiſe, but not with God. The thing that we muſt aime at in the practiſe of gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, meekneſſe, temperancie, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, patience, and other workes of the Spirit in vs, is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, that men ſeeing theſe fruites of the Spirit in vs, they may be brought vnto the ſame obedience and ſeruice of one God with vs. And thus it ſhall come to paſſe, that they who haply haue ſaid in their hearts, there is no God, that they who cannot yet grow to the liking of the ſame truth with vs, ſhall ſay of vs, Surely God is in you indeed, ſurely this is the way of truth wherein ye do walke.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore hearken vnto the exhortation of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and as he exhorteth let our patient mind be knowne vnto all men. Let vs not bangle and wrangle one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for euery light matter, but let vs beare one with another, and yeeld one vnto another. Let vs not after the fancie of our owne reaſon abridge that which the holy Ghoſt enlargeth, but let our moderation be knowne to all, without exception of any. And let vs in the practiſe both of this and of euery Chriſtian vertue, aime at the glorie of God, and the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his holy truth which we profeſſe. And as this day we profeſſe by our meeting at this holy Table, ſound loue and charitie with all men, ſo at all times let our moderation and patient mind be knowne vnto all men.</p>

                     <hi>The Lord is at hand.</hi> This reaſon, as I told you, is added to preuent an obiection.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>The Lord is at hand:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid; Though they abuſe your patient mildneſſe and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moderation of your affections, yet do ye hold on a good courſe, in patience poſſeſſe your ſoules, and let your patient mind be knowne vnto all men: for the Lord is at hand: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe indeed your caſe were hard, if the Lord were farre from you, and lookt not at you, nor regarded you to helpe you in e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uery time of need, and to relieue you in euery your wrongs:
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:599:477"/> But the Lord is at hand. Now we muſt vnderſtand that the Lord is ſaid to be at hand, after diuers ſorts in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                     <hi>The Lord is neare vnto all that call vpon him, yea to all that call vpon him in truth:</hi> he is neare vnto them to heare them, and to helpe them.

In the third ſenſe alſo, the Lord is at hand, both to the wicked, and to the godly, to render vengeance in flaming fire vnto the wicked, and to crowne the godly with a crowne of glorie and immortalitie in the heauens.

<pb n="794" facs="tcp:599:480"/> me, in what danger ſoeuer I be, I will feare no euill. This then, to know that the Lord is with vs, and that he is alwaies neare at hand to heare vs and to helpe vs, ſhould quiet vs, as of all feare, ſo of all perturbations of the minde, ſo that we ſhould patiently brooke whatſoeuer might otherwiſe ſtirre vs vnto impatiencie.</p>
                  <p>How is it then that vpon euery occaſion we are ſo vnpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and haue ſo little hold of our ſelues? If any man thwart or croſſe vs, if any man harme or wrong vs, if any man taunt or mocke vs, if any man reuile or ſpeake euill of vs, if anie man offer vs any hard meaſure in word or in deed, how do we bite vpon the bridle, and ſtomacke the matter? One abuſe muſt be quit with another, one wrong with another, one miſchiefe with another, or elſe we think we haue neuer plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the men. But if we be falſly accuſed before the Iudge, of theft, murder, ſedition, treaſon or the like; if we be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſcourged, impriſoned, racked, or tormented; if we be cruelly or deceitfully turned out of houſe and home, lands and liuing, and all that we haue: O how then are our ſoules diſquieted within vs, and how do our hearts burnt within vs till we be auenged of ſuch as haue thus dealt with vs? Here muſt reuenge be ſought by bloud, death, and if there be any further reuenge then this.</p>
                  <p>And tell me I pray, what is the cauſe of ſuch impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in theſe and the like caſes, yea oftentimes when the Lord his hand is vpon vs in pouertie, ſickenes, and the like? Is it not euen hence, becauſe either we know not, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not that the Lord is at hand? Yes verily, it is the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or forgetfulneſſe of the Lord, and of his prouident watchfulneſſe ouer vs, that makes vs fret and fume, and like the dogge runne vpon the bone that is caſt at vs. We know not, or we remember not that vengeance is the Lords, and that he hath promiſed that he will repay and reward the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked after their deſeruing: and therefore forſooth, when we thinke there is cauſe, we will be diſquieted, we will kill and ſlay, and we will be auenged. For if we knew or remembred that vengeance is the Lords, and that he wil repay, we would patiently paſſe by the contumelies and wrongs of men, and
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:599:480"/> leaue them to the Lord that iudgeth righteous iudgement. We know not, or we remember not, that the Lord is neare vnto all that call vpon him in truth to heare and help vs in all dangers, if we patiently waite vpon him, that we may be ſafe vnder his feathers; and therefore forſooth when troubles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault vs, or the ſorrows of death compaſſe vs about, we thinke we do well to be as vnpatient as <hi>Ionas</hi> was angrie for his gourd. For if we knew, or remembred, that he is at hand at euerie needfull time of trouble to helpe vs, our ſoules would patiently wait vpon the Lord vntill he ſhould helpe vs. Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we thinke not of the Lord and of his watchfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ouer vs to ſaue and defend vs, and to auenge our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and wrongs; or carnally we ſay, if the Lord be at hand, I wiſh I might know it, I wiſh I might heare him, I wiſh I might ſee him, as if otherwiſe we could not diſcerne of his being neare vnto vs; or if we be better taught, yet we thinke him not neare if he do not alwayes heare and helpe when we wiſh and call. And therefore euery ſmall thing and leaſt trifle almoſt moues vs, and diſquiets vs, and puts vs out of all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoeuer therefore contumelies or diſgraces are offred vnto vs, whatſoeuer loſſes or wrongs we ſuſtaine, whatſoeuer troubles or tentations do aſſault vs, whatſoeuer malice or wickednes be practiſed againſt vs, let vs know that the Lord his prouidence watcheth ouer vs to ſaue &amp; defend vs, to take our matter into his owne hand, and to be auenged of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And therefore let vs not he diſcouraged, or diſquie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, let vs not fret or fume, or buſie our heads with thinking of reuenge, but let vs in our patience poſſeſſe our ſoules, and let our patient mind be knowne to all men. If we cannot by our moderation and mildnes, by our gentlenes and patience winne them vnto vs that in word or deed wrong vs, but that they like vnto wicked <hi>Iulians</hi> the more abuſe vs and wrong vs, yet the Lord is at hand to behold our ſufferings &amp; wrongs, and to take our matter into his owne hand. To bridle then our impatience let vs thinke with our ſelues; Are we euill entreated through tyrants? doth our owne familiar friend lie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n waite againſt vs? do ſome imagine miſchiefe for vs, others
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:599:481"/> whet their tongues againſt vs, and ſhoote out their arrowes, euen bitter words, and do others practiſe what they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs? Well, the Lord is at hand, he ſeeth and knoweth all things, he deliuereth vs, and auengeth vs of all that riſe vp againſt vs, when, and as it ſeemes good vnto him. He that keepeth vs ſlumbereth not, nor ſleepeth; and therefore in our patience will we poſſeſſe our ſoules, repoſing our ſelues vnder the couert of his wings. Thus if we ſhall lift vp our eies vnto the Lord, and perſwade our ſelues of his being alwaies neare at hand vnto vs by his watchfull prouidence ouer vs, we ſhall not only not be troubled with theſe ſharp fits of this hote ague of impatience vpon euery accident or croſſe, but as men truly humbled in our ſelues, mortified vnto the world, and looking onely vnto the Lord, we ſhall in all mildneſſe and moderation make our patient minde knowne vnto all men. And let this be ſpoken of this obſeruation from this meaning of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, admitting this to be the meaning of the Apoſtle in this place, that the Lord is at hand by his ſecond comming in the fleſh vnto iudgement to requite our hard meaſures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their boſome that haue ill meated vnto vs, and to wipe all teares from our eyes, and giue vs reſt with himſelfe, I note that the Apoſtles reaſon to moue the <hi>Philippians</hi> vnto a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mildneſſe and gentle moderation towards all men, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord is at hand to breake the clouds, and to come vnto iudgement, to wipe all teares from their eyes, and to recompence tribulation to all that haue troubled them. And hence I obſerue another ſpeciall motiue which may &amp; ought to perſwade vs to poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience whenſoeuer we are abuſed, oppeſſed, or afflicted, namely, the approching of Chriſt his ſecond coming into iudgement, when he ſhall recompence tribulation to them that trouble vs, and to vs which are troubled reſt with him. This motiue alſo vnto pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> vſeth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iames</hi> 5.7.8.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Be ye patient vnto the coming of the Lord: Be ye patient and ſettle your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth neare.</hi> And certainly if we could and would remember this, that the coming of the Lord draweth neare, we would be leſſe prouoked vpon euery oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:599:481"/> vnto intemperate heates, and whatſoeuer might haply ſeeme enough to diſquiet vs, we would paſſe it ouer with greater patience. For thus we ſhould ſay with our ſelues: Hath God giuen all iudgement vnto his Son, and is he readie to come vnto iudgement? Is the time at hand when he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from heauen with a ſhoute, and with the voice of the Archangell, and with the trumpet of God? when he ſhal ſhew himſelfe in flaming fire, rendring vengeance vnto them that know not God, nor obey the Goſpel of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt? when he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be maruellous in all them that beleeue? Shall I then when I am abuſed or wronged, be grieued and diſquieted, or ſeek to be auenged? Nay, the time is at hand when all wrongs ſhall be redreſſed by him that iudgeth righteouſly: in the meane time I will beare with patience what man doth or ſaith againſt me. Thus by remembrance of the approching of Chriſt his ſecond coming vnto iudgment, ſhould our patient mind be knowne vnto all men.</p>
                  <p>O but, will fooliſh man ſay, this hath bene ſaid theſe fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred yeares, that the Lord is at hand, and that his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming draweth neare, and yet all things continue alike; how ſhould this then ſtill be a motiue vnto patience? When this ſecond coming ſhall be, I cannot ſay.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7.</note> It is a thing <hi>which the Father hath kept in his owne power,</hi> and ſo peculiarly reſerued vnto himſelfe, as that <hi>of that day and houre knoweth no man,</hi>

But hath it bene ſaid theſe fifteene hundred yeares, that the Lord is at hand, and that his coming draweth neare?

                     <hi>The Lord is patient toward vs, and would haue no man to periſh, but would all men to come to repentance,</hi> and therefore hath hitherto deferred his coming. But <hi>yet a very litle while,</hi>

<pb n="798" facs="tcp:599:482"/> foretold to go before his ſecond coming, is not already paſt, except it be that one of the calling of the Iewes? Let the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation then of our Apoſtle preuaile with vs, that our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient mind be knowne to all men.

                     <hi>Be nothing carefull.</hi> In theſe words we haue another exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vnto the <hi>Philippians;</hi> wherein the Apoſtle diſſwadeth one thing, perſwadeth another thing, and noteth the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or effect which will follow vpon both. The thing which he diſſwadeth, is, too great carefulneſſe for the things of this life, and for the euent of ſuch things as commonly we take in hand and haue to deale withall, in theſe words, <hi>Be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing carefull.</hi> Where the word vſed by the Apoſtle, ſignifieth
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:599:482"/> oftentimes a diffident carefulnes, ſuch as diſtracteth the mind ſundrie wayes, and almoſt eateth vp a man; ſuch as is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous mans carefulnes, whoſe mind runneth ſo ſtill vpon his matters, as that not daring either to depend vpon God, or the faithfulneſſe of any man for the euent of them, his turmoiled thoughts are alwayes buſied about them. Which carefulnes being an euill carefulnes, the Apoſtle diſſwadeth it, ſaying, <hi>be nothing carefull,</hi> that is, let it be farre from you to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſuch worldly and diſtruſtfull carefulneſſe for any thing in this life, or for the euent of any thing that you haue to deale withall. The thing which he perſwadeth, is, in all things to flie vnto God by prayer, as depending wholly vpon him, and committing all their wayes vnto him. So that as he would not haue them too carefull about any thing, ſo he would not haue them careleſſe in any thing, but in all things to flie vnto God, powring out ſuch prayers vnto him as may be accepted with him. Where firſt note the antitheſis, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Be carefull for nothing, but in all things, &amp;c.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly note the diſtribution of prayer into his diuers kinds, <hi>Let your requeſts,</hi> or ſuites, or petitions, there is the generall; <hi>be ſhewed vnto God in prayer, and ſupplication, with giuing of thanks;</hi> prayer, ſupplication and thankſgiuing, theſe be the kinds or particulars comprehended vnder the generall. By <hi>requeſts</hi> therefore is meant generally whatſoeuer prayer is made vnto God for the obtaining of that which is good, or auoiding of that which is euil. By <hi>prayer</hi> is meant ſuch prayer as we powre out vnto God for bleſſings corporall or ſpirituall, temporall or eternall. By <hi>ſupplication</hi> is meant ſuch prayer as we make vnto God for preſeruing vs from euils corporall or ſpirituall, temporall or eternall. By <hi>giuing of thankes</hi> is meant a thankfull praiſing of God for benefits beſtowed vpon vs, or for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from euils. And all theſe are commonly in all the prayers of the faithfull, as wherein both they giue thankes vnto God for bleſſings receiued, and preſeruation from euils; and alſo pray vnto God for the things which are good, and to be deliuered from the things which are euill. Thirdly, note this that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let your requeſts be ſhewed vnto God,</hi> or be made knowne vnto God; not as if their requeſts, or
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:599:483"/> any thing elſe were not knowne vnto God; but the meaning is, either that their requeſts ſhould be knowne by an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge vnto God, ſo that they ſhould be accepted with him; or that their requeſts ſhould be knowne, not vnto men, as their patient mind was to be knowne, but vnto God. The thing then which he perſwadeth in effect is this, in all things whatſoeuer to depend vpon God, and to flie vnto him by prayer, both powring out acceptable prayers vnto him for obtaining of good things and deliuerance from euill things, and giuing him thankes for bleſſings in good things and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from euill. The conſequence or effect which will follow vpon both, the thing diſſwaded and the thing perſwaded, the Apoſtle noteth in the next verſe, <hi>And the peace, &amp;c.</hi> So that theſe words deuide themſelues into theſe three branches: firſt a dehortation from a thing which is euill, in theſe words, <hi>Be nothing carefull;</hi> ſecondly, an exhortation vnto a thing which is good, in theſe words, <hi>But in all things, </hi> thirdly, a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or effect which will follow vpon flying the euill and following the good, in theſe words, <hi>And the peace. &amp;c.</hi> Now let vs ſee whit we may gather hence for our vſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which I note, is the Apoſtles dehortation, wherein he diſſwadeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> from all worldly and diſtruſtfull carefulnes for any thing in this life, or the euent of any thing that they haue to deale withall. Whence I obſerue a fault which we are by all meanes to take heed of and to flie, namely, too too great carefulnes for the things of this life. We may not in any wiſe ſo trouble our ſelues with turmoiling thoughts and cares for the things of this life, or the euent of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing we haue to deale withall, as if we durſt not depend vpon God, or the faithfulneſſe of any man, vnleſſe our owne cares alſo were continually employed about them. Carefulnes and diligence in all our labours is requiſite and neceſſarie, but worldly and diſtruſtfull carefulneſſe for any thing is wretched and vngodly. For the better conceiuing therfore of this note, we are to vnderſtand that there are three ſorts of carefulnes: one godly and neceſſarie; another worldly and wicked; and a third mixt of both, neither ſimply godly, nor ſimply wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but mixt of both. A godly carefulnes it is when we giue
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:599:483"/> all diligence to do the workes of our callings with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, doing that which we ſhould, and commending the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vnto God. And ſo farre is it off, that this ſhould be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked or forbidden here or elſewhere, that it is euery where commanded, and by example in the godly commended vnto vs. <hi>He that ruleth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>let him do it with diligence.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 8.</note>

The Apoſtle witneſſeth this carefulneſſe to haue bene in himſelfe, where he ſaith, that he had the care of all the Churches;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.1. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.2.</note> that he had great figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or as ſome tranſlate, great care for the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> that he ſpake the Goſpell of God vnto the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> with much ſtriuing, or care, as ſome tranſlate. And the ſame Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth this carefulnes in <hi>Timothy</hi> towards the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who faithfully cared for their matters;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.20.</note> in <hi>Epaphras</hi> towards the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> who in his prayers was always careful for them;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</note> and in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in whom their godly ſorrow had wrought great care. And generally this care is ſo neceſſarily requiſite in the Prince for his people, in the Paſtor for his flocke, in the houſholder for his houſhold, and in euery man for himſelfe, that either he muſt be thus carefull, faithfully to do the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ties of his calling, whatſoeuer it be, and to leaue the ſucceſſe of his labours whatſoeuer vnto the Lord, or elſe he cannot be godly.</p>
                  <p>Another carefulneſſe there is, neither ſimply good, nor ſimply euill, but mixt of both, namely when we are carefull to do the duties of our calling, and withall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelues too much about the euent of things, which we ſhould leaue wholly to the Lord. And this carefulnes is good ſo farre as it makes vs carefull to do the duties of our calling. But in that hereby we trouble our ſelues too much about the
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:599:484"/> euent of our labours and ſucceſſe of our buſineſſe, it is euill. For this is to be left vnto the Lord, according to that of the Prophet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Commit thy way vnto the Lord, and truſt in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe.</hi> We are to do that we ought by the dutie of our place and calling, and the Lord he muſt giue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the bleſſing, and the euent, and we muſt pray and wait for it from him. Otherwiſe howſoeuer our carefulneſſe be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that we ought, yet is it euill, becauſe it is more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed thereabout then it ought.</p>
                  <p>A third carefulnes there is, which is worldly, and ariſeth of diſtruſt in God, which is when men are too too much carefull of the things of this life, and of the euent of the things they haue to deale withall, as that the thought thereof troubleth them day and night, cauſeth their ſleepe to depart from their eyes, and euen eateth them vp aliue. This is the carefulneſſe which the Apoſtle here forbiddeth, not the firſt, nor the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, but ſo much as it is linked in with this laſt about the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of things. So that as I ſaid before, we may not in any wiſe ſo trouble our ſelues with turmoyling thoughts and cares for the things of this life, or the euent of any thing we haue to deale withall, as if we durſt not depend vpon God, or the faithfulnes of any man, vnleſſe our owne cares alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually employed about them. This alſo our bleſſed Sauiour forbiddeth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Be not carefull for your life, what ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drinke, nor yet for your bodie what ye ſhall put on.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7.</note> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe, where he ſaith, <hi>Caſt all your care on him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22.</note> And the Prophet alſo, where he ſaith, <hi>Caſt thy burden,</hi> or thy care <hi>vpon the Lord, and he ſhall nouriſh thee.</hi> As if the Prophet and the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid: Be ye nothing carefull, but if there be any thing that troubles you, any thing which may cauſe you to care, caſt it off your ſelfe, and caſt it vpon the Lord. Which carefulneſſe if it were onely thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the holy Ghoſt, it ſhould be ſufficient either for the not entertaining, or for the diſlodging of ſuch a gueſt being entertained. But beſides that it is forbidden, there are many other reaſons alſo why this ouermuch carefulnes ſhould vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be abandoned from among the ſonnes of God. For firſt, whence ariſeth this euill among the ſonnes of men of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:599:484"/> carking and caring for the things of this life? Is it not from our ignorance or diſtruſt of Gods prouidence and care ouer vs? Yes ſurely, either we know not that he can and will, or elſe we doubt whether he can and will prouide for vs and ours when age, or pouertie, or ſickneſſe, or famine, or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, or baniſhment, or the like ſhall befall vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſcratch and ſcrape together all that euer we can, leſt when either ſome of thoſe things ſhall ſurpriſe vs, or the charge of family and children ſhall grow vpon vs, we ſhould periſh in the needfull time of trouble. And hereupon it is that our bleſſed Sauiour ſets vs vnto the fowles of the heauen, that by them we may be taught in the prouidence and care of God ouer vs. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the fowles of the heauen;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.26.</note> 
                     <hi>for they ſow not, neither reape, nor carrie into the barnes, yet your heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feedeth them. Are not ye much better then they?</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid: Gods prouidence and care watcheth ouer the fowles of the heauen to feed them, which yet are far mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and baſer creatures then your ſelues; how ſhould ye then ſeeing this, either not know, or doubt of Gods prouidence &amp; care ouer you? They ſow not, nor reape, nor carrie into the barnes, and yet God feedeth them; how ſhould ye then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, when ye haue plowed and ſowen, commit the reſt vnto the Lord, and without farther carking or caring, to truſt ſurely that he will feed you? Thus we ſee how our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour to beate downe our immoderate carefulnes, inſtructeth vs in Gods prouidence ouer vs, and thereby ſheweth plainly that the root whence this vnmeaſurable carefulnes ſpringeth, is ignorance or diſtruſt in Gods prouidence ouer vs. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to what vſe or profite is our ouermuch carking and caring for the things of this life? Is it not in vain, and to no vſe at all? The Prophet tels vs ſo, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.2.</note> 
                     <hi>It is in vaine for you to riſe vp early, and to lie downe late, and to eate the bread of careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, Early riſing to worke and labor, going late to bed from worke, all the care that we can take is in vaine and to no purpoſe, except the Lord giue a bleſſing vnto it. To which purpoſe alſo is that of our bleſſed Sauiour, where he ſaith, <hi>Which of you by taking care,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.27.</note> 
                     <hi>is able to adde one cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite vnto his ſtature?</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, As it is in vaine
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:599:485"/> for him that is of a low ſtature to trouble his thoughts about the adding of any thing vnto his ſtature, becauſe when he hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much care that way as he can, yet he cannot adde one cubit, or one hand breadth, or one inch vnto his ſtature; ſo is it in vain for any man to vex himſelf &amp; trouble his thoughts about the gathering of riches, or the euent of his labours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when he hath taken as much care as he can, yet not by his care are his riches increaſed, but by the Lord his bleſſing, who maketh poore and maketh rich;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7.</note> nor by his care doth his corne grow, his ſhips returne from farre countries, or his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours proſper in any thing, but by the Lord onely, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth increaſe, and a bleſſing vnto euery thing at his pleaſure. And albeit it may be, that ſome couetous miſers and wretches of the world, may by fraud and guile, or how elſe ſoeuer ſcrape and ſcratch more riches together then they ſhould, yet riches ſo gotten, are rather the beginning of pouertie then of riches. For,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12.</note> as the Preacher ſaith, <hi>Riches</hi> ſo gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>are reſerued</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp <hi>to the owners thereof for their euill.</hi> For either they are as a fretting canker vnto the reſt, to bring the owners thereof vnto pouertie, or elſe they are gathered for him that wil ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. So that to be ouermuch carefull, is altogether in vaine and vnprofitable. And thirdly, as it is vaine and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, ſo is it alſo pernicious and hurtfull. For whiles our thoughts are running vp and downe vpon this or that matter, whiles we are troubled with cares here or there, while the things of this life, and the euent of things we deale withall runnes in our heads, and toſſeth vs to and fro as billowes in the ſea, we are not onely diſpoſſeſt of euery good thought, &amp; euery good care, but if any good thought or care be ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted vnto vs, it is quite choked by theſe worldly cares of this life. This is clearely proued by that in the parable of the ſeed, where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.18.19.</note> that <hi>they that receiue the ſeed among the thornes, are ſuch as heare the word, but the cares of this world, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe of riches, and the luſts of other things enter in and choke the word and it is vnfruitfull:</hi> the cares of this world choke the word. Great reaſon then ye ſee, why we ſhould abandon this ouermuch carefulneſſe, becauſe it is forbidden by the holy Ghoſt, becauſe it ſpringeth from the ignorance or diſtruſt of
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:599:485"/> Gods prouidence, becauſe it is in vaine and vnprofitable, and becauſe it is pernicious and hurtfull. Adde alſo hereunto, that <hi>the day hath enough with his owne griefe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.34.</note> as our Sauiour telleth vs: as if he ſhould haue ſaid, The care that euerie day brings with it, is enough to trouble our ſelues withall, though we do not increaſe our preſent griefe by the carefulneſſe of this, how we may liue in time to come.</p>
                  <p>This then may teach vs to moderate our cares, that they be not exceſſiue and vnmeaſurable. The prohibition of ſuch carefulneſſe is ſtrait, the cauſe of it is euill, the vſe of it is none, the hurt of it is great. Let vs not therefore ſuffer our ſelues to be turmoiled with ſuch cares. Let ſuch cares be left vnto the couetous worldling which hath made the wedge of gold his god, which ſtill cryeth, Giue, giue, and neuer ſaith he hath enough, but the more he hath, the more he craueth.

For this is iuſt the caſe of him that immoderately ſcrapes and ſcratches, carkes and cares, perhaps for an vnthrift, perhaps for a ſtranger, perhaps for an enemy. He eates vp, and waſts and conſumes himſelfe with care, and oftentimes enioyes no pleaſure of that he hath. But let ſuch care be farre from vs, and if ſuch cares haue ſurpriſed any of vs, let vs ſhake them off, and following the counſell of our Apoſtle, let vs be carefull for nothing.</p>
                  <p>What then! ſhould we be idle, and careleſſe, and let the world runne as it liſteth? ſhould we do nothing, care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but leaue all things, as they ſay, to Fortune, and let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing be as it be may, and fall out as it can? Not ſo. We are not to be idle: no ſuch thing ſpoken of in our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;

We are to care; for not euery care is forbidden here in our Apoſtle; but we are not to be ouermuch careful for any thing, ſo as the worldling careth, and killeth himſelfe with care. We are not when we haue done what we can and ought, to caſt all care away, and to leaue all things, as they ſay, to the hazard, to fall out as they can; but the euent and ſucceſſe to leaue vnto God, always depending vpon him, and flying vnto him by prayer, and ſupplication, and giuing of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7.</note> This then muſt be our care, to do that we ought, and then to commit the bleſſing of all vnto the Lord. We may not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly fling off all care of our matters, but we muſt carefully commend them vnto God, and depend vpon him for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon them, and ſucceſſe vnto them. In all things we muſt haue this care, by humble and hearty prayer to flie vnto the Lord, to pray vnto him for the obtaining of ſuch good things as we want, to pray vnto him for deliuerance from euills, eyther now preſently vpon vs, or which we feare may fall vpon vs, and to giue him thankes for ſuch bleſſings as in the riches of his mercies he hath vouchſafed vnto vs. This care God requireth of vs, and this care the godly haue alwayes had, as might largely haue bene proued, if time had giuen leaue; and this is the Chriſtian and godly care which now I commend vnto you, faithfully to do the dueties of your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, committing your wayes vnto the Lord, depending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his prouidence alwayes, and in all things flying vnto him by humble and hearty prayer, with giuing of thankes.</p>
                  <p>Let this then firſt teach vs, not to be idle, or careleſſe in matters: for this is not the thing forbidden, to labour, or to do the workes of our calling, but to be too too carefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that we do, or haue to do: and though we may not be too too carefull about that we do, or haue to do, yet may we not be careleſſe, or ſay as the maner of ſome is, let the world wag as it liſt, care ſhall neither kill me, nor touch me. This careleſneſſe beſeemeth not the children of God, but is a note of retchleſſe perſons, ſuch as not onely caſt all care away, but alſo all honeſtie, godlineſſe, and goodneſſe. As therefore too much carefulneſſe, ſo let this careleſneſſe be farre from eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this teach vs ſo to labour and do all that we haue to do, as that ſtill we depend vpon the Lord his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and care ouer vs, and in all things flie vnto him by praier, and ſupplication, with giuing of thankes. It is he that muſt bleſſe our labours, and giue a good end vnto our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. We onely can do that we ought to do, and then com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mend both it and our ſelues vnto the Lord, in humble and
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:599:487"/> heartie prayer. Which if it were ſo well thought of as it ſhould be, many of politike complots and deuices might very well be ſpared: for we plot, and deuiſe, and caſt, and winde vp and downe about this matter and that matter, as if we by our maine wit would bring that to paſſe, which the Lord otherwiſe either could not, or would not. Well, the beſt plot that I can tell you of is this, faithfully do ye that which ye ought to do, pray vnto the Lord for his bleſſing vpon it, and ſo commit it vnto him, that he may do in it what he will, and what ſeemeth beſt vnto him. This I am ſure is the beſt plot, becauſe the moſt Chriſtian. Let this therefore be our Chriſtian policie: let vs feare the Lord, and walke in his wayes; let vs do the duties of our calling, whatſoeuer we haue to do, let vs labour therein as we ought, and let vs pray vnto the Lord for his bleſſing vpon it, let vs commit it vnto him, and then let him do as he will.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Another thing there is which I would obſerue from the words of the exhortation of our Apoſtle in this place. The chiefe ſcope and drift of his exhortation we haue alreadie heard, which is, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> would caſt their care on God, and in all things runne vnto him by prayer, pouring out ſuch prayers vnto him as may be accepted with him, for
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:599:487"/> his bleſſing vpon what they do and deſire, &amp; for deliuerance from ſuch euills as preſently they ſuffer, or feare to follow. Where note that the Apoſtle would haue their requeſts to be ſhewed vnto God by praier and ſupplication, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all there ſhould be ioyned giuing of thankes. Whence I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that as prayer and ſupplication, ſo giuing of thankes alſo is a neceſſary ſeruice of God, a neceſſary duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. For, as there are many cauſes of our often approching vnto the throne of grace by prayer and ſupplication for bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in good things, and deliuerance from euill, ſo are there many cauſes of pouring out our ſoules before God in humble praiſe and heartie thankeſgiuing for bleſſings in good things, and deliuerance from euill. Neither is there any whoſe wants or miſeries vrge them vnto prayer and ſupplication, which haue not alſo ſuch proofes of Gods mercies and louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards them, as may and ought to prouoke them vnto thankeſgiuing. Many are the bleſſings and graces for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, for the ſoule, for this life preſent, for that that is to come, which enforce our prayers vnto God that we may obtaine them. Many are the euills touching the body, touching the ſoule, touching this life preſent, touching that that is to come, which enforce our ſupplications vnto God that we may be deliuered from them. And are there not as many bleſſings and graces corporall and ſpirituall, temporall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, which the Lord hath already vouchſafed vnto vs? as many euills corporall and ſpirituall, temporall and eternall, from which the Lord hath deliuered vs, which ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force our praiſe and thankſgiuing vnto God? Yes verily, but that rather we looke vnto the things which we would haue, then vnto the things which already we haue receiued, we might as wel ſee the one as the other. And hereupon it is, that as well praiſe and thankeſgiuing are commanded by the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture, as prayer and ſupplication, and that the godly in al ages haue poured out their ſoules before God as well in praiſe and thankeſgiuing, as in prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>I exhort</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle vnto <hi>Timothie) that firſt of all ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions,</hi>

Generally this note hath ſo well tuned at all times in the mouthes of all Gods children, that they haue euer bene ready to giue thanks vnto him in all things, euen as ready to offer vnto the Lord the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiuing for benefits and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings receiued, as to poure out their praiers vnto him for ſuch graces of his Spirit as they ſtood in need of.</p>
                  <p>But is it ſo with vs? Haue our mouthes bene filled with the praiſes of the Lord, and with thankeſgiuing vnto our God?

<pb n="811" facs="tcp:599:488"/> ſickeneſſe, or famine, or ſword: it may be, I ſay, we will do ſo, though to too ſeldome we do ſo: But when the Lord in mercie hath remoued any of theſe his plagues from vs, what ſacrifice of praiſe and thankeſgiuing do we offer vp vnto him?

We indeed of this place whence others ſhould haue all good example, are ſo much afraid to ſeeme forward in good things, that we are hardly or neuer drawne vnto it in time of common danger to faſt and pray, or after deliuerance from ſuch danger to praiſe and giue thankes. Our prayers for Prince, for people, for peace, for proſperitie, for raine, for faire weather, in time of famine, in time of warre, in time of common ſickeneſſe, and the like which we vſe, are good, and very good. And were it not well that our requeſts were ſhewed vnto God in prayer and ſupplication with giuing of thankes? If euerie man ſhall looke into himſelfe, we ſhall all of vs finde a great defect in our ſelues this way. For if the hand of the Lord be any way
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:599:489"/> vpon vs, then we call vpon him, and pray vnto him; as for example, if we be ſicke, then we poure out our requeſts vnto God for health, and for deliuerance from that paine wherein we lie. But how many of vs do then remember to praiſe the Lord, either for that health which before the Lord gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, or for other good graces and bleſſings of the ſoule and of the bodie, wherewith euen then we do abound? Nay ſurely the paine of our ſickeneſſe takes ſuch hold on vs, that onely we remember it, and pray to be deliuered from it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the praiſes of the Lord for other his mercies vnto vs. And afterward, when we are reſtored vnto health, how many of vs do ſing a new Song vnto the Lord for it? We commend our Phyſition, or ſuch a potion that we tooke, or ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that was applyed, or ſuch a diet that we kept; but not many of vs ſing the praiſes of the Lord, by whoſe onely bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon thoſe meanes we haue recouered our health. I do inſtance onely in this one example. But the like is to be ſaid of other croſſes. If we be in pouerty, in impriſonment, in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; yea if our head, or tooth, or toe do ake, and the like, we poure out our complaints before God, and make our prayers vnto him. But how ſeldome are our requeſts ſhewed vnto him with giuing of thankes?</p>
                  <p>I diſpute not the point, whether together with our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications ſhould alwayes be ioyned praiſe and thankeſgiuing. Sure it is, that there is none of vs all, in any ſuch need or neceſſitie, in any ſuch miſerie or affliction, but we haue many bleſſings of the Lord, for which we ought to be thankfull. So that as we haue need to pray vnto the Lord, ſo we haue cauſe alſo to giue thankes vnto the Lord euen then when we pray. But this is it which I vrge, that as we are to pray vnto the Lord for ſuch things as we neede, ſo we are to giue thankes vnto the Lord for ſuch bleſſings as we haue receiued. For this is true, that whatſoeuer it be that we aske, we are not worthie new bleſſings and graces, vnleſſe we be thankefull for the old. And this is as true, that ſo our payers are accepted with God, as we are thankfull vnto God. Our vnthankefulneſſe ſhuts out our prayers that they enter not into the eares of the Lord God of hoaſts. And amongſt
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:599:489"/> other our ſinnes, in my iudgement, our vnthankfulneſſe is one great cauſe why the hand of the Lord now a long time hath bene, and yet is ſo heauie vpon vs. Of late, euen by the ſpace of a twelue moneth, he hath giuen vs great hope of remouing one of his plagues of dearth and famine from vs by ſuch ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſeaſons as he hath granted vnto vs. But haue we ſung ſongs of thankſgiuing for this mercie of the Lord towards vs? No ſurely: and therefore now again he hath filled the clouds with raine, and threatneth vs with vnſeaſonable weather. Let vs therefore now at length returne from our vnthankfulnes, and ſing new ſongs of praiſes vnto the Lord. Whenſoeuer we haue need, let vs pray vnto the Lord, but withal let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the louing mercies of the Lord towards vs, and let vs giue him thanks for them. Otherwiſe our requeſts wil ſooner turne into murmuring complaints, then vnto acceptable prayers. As therefore the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſo do I you, <hi>Whatſoeuer ye do in word or deed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſſ</hi> 3.17.</note> 
                     <hi>do all in the name of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, &amp;c.</hi> and as our Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>Let your requeſts, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the peace of God, &amp;c.</hi> This is the conſequent or effect which wil follow vpon it, if we hearken vnto the exhortation. If we ſhall be too too carefull for nothing, but in all things flie vnto God by prayer, giuing him thankes for bleſſings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and powring out our prayers and ſupplications vnto him for ſuch things as are neceſſarie: what then? then this wil follow, the peace of God which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, ſhall preſerue your hearts and minds in Chriſt Ieſus, that ye fall not away from Chriſt Ieſus by any inordinate affections, or wicked cogitations, through impatience or deſpaire, but that ye haue a quiet mind and conſcience in all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer do befall vnto you. Now for the more particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe things, we muſt vnderſtand, that where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the peace of God,</hi> he meaneth not that peace which is in God, and which is himſelf, but that peace which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth vnto vs. Which yet is two fold: one, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth our reconciliation with God through Chriſt, whereof the Angels ſpake in their ſong, when they ſung,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Glorie be to God on hie, and in earth peace;</hi> and whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh when he ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt came,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17.</note> 
                     <hi>and preached peace to them which
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:599:490"/> were a farre off, and to them which were neare.</hi> In both which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by <hi>peace</hi> is meant our reconciliation with God through Chriſt, and of this peace of God, the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh not. Another peace there is which God communicateth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, which is the peace and quietneſſe of our mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience through our reconciliation with God by Ieſus Chriſt, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh when he ſaith, that <hi>being iuſtified by faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note> 
                     <hi>we haue peace towards God, through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Where by <hi>peace</hi> is meant that quietnes of mind and conſcience which we haue through our iuſtification by faith in Chriſt Ieſus. And of this our Apoſtle here ſpeaketh, and ſaith of it, that it <hi>paſſeth all vnderſtanding,</hi> that is, that this inward peace of our mind and conſcience, wrought in vs by the power of the Spirit through our reconciliation with God, and iuſtification by faith in the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus, is ſuch a thing as all mans vnderſtanding cannot reach vnto or comprehend. This peace of God then, which thus farre paſſeth all reach of mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Apoſtle tels the <hi>Philippians</hi> if they hearken to his exhortation, ſhall keepe their hearts and minds, that is, their whole ſoules, both the vnderſtanding and the ſenſitiue part, in Chriſt Ieſus, ſo that neither through inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which are ſeated in the heart, nor through wicked co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations in the mind, they ſhould fall away from the faith of Chriſt Ieſus in their heart, or from the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus in their mind. The ſumme of all is this, that if they will hearken vnto his exhortation, to be nothing carefull, but in all things to ſhew their requeſts vnto God in prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, with giuing of thankes, then they ſhall haue ſuch a peace and quietneſſe of mind and conſcience, as farre paſſeth all reach of mans vnderſtanding, which ſhall keep their hearts and minds, euen their whole ſoules in Chriſt Ieſus, ſo that they ſhall not fall from him, either through inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or wicked cogitations. I cannot ſtand vpon the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obſeruations which were hence to be made; I will onely point at ſome of them, as time will giue leaue.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then hence I obſerue, what the fruite or conſequent is which followeth the laying aſide of ouermuch carefulnes, and the repoſing of our ſelues in God by prayer in all our matters.
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:599:490"/> The conſequent or fruit which followeth vpon it, is, the peace of God, the peace which God giueth vnto our minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to keepe as with a garriſon our hearts and minds in Chriſt Ieſus. For whileſt we are choked with the cares of this life, and thoughts do boyle within our breaſts as in a fornace of lead, whileſt it is ſo that we cannot perſwade our ſelues to depend vpon God for the euent and ſucceſſe of our matters, vnleſſe our owne cares alſo be continually employed about them, what peace or quietnes can we haue in our minds and conſciences? The peace of our minds and conſciences indeed conſiſteth in our reconciliation with God through Chriſt, in our iuſtification by faith in the bloud of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth in the place before alledged, where he ſaith, that <hi>being iuſtified by faith, we haue peace towards God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note> 
                     <hi>through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> But what reconciliation with God, where the loue of the world ſo ſwayeth, that his thoughts are altogether ſet vpon it, his cares are wholly employed about it?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Know ye not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iames) that the amitie of the world is the enmitie of God? Whoſoeuer therefore maketh himſelfe a friend of the world, maketh himſelfe the enemie of God.</hi> As good communion betwixt light and darkneſſe, as good concord betwixt Chriſt and Belial, as good agreement betwixt the temple of God and idols, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the loue of God and the loue of the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man loue the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.15.</note> 
                     <hi>the loue of the Father is not in him.</hi> So that where there is this exceſſiue loue of the world, as to carrie all our cares and thoughts after it, it is a ſigne that there is no reconciliation with God, and therefore no peace of conſcience. But if we ſhall lay aſide all worldly and diſtruſtfull carefulnes, and caſt our care vpon the Lord; if we ſhal walke as we ought, and commit our wayes vnto the Lord; if we ſhall pray vnto the Lord for his bleſſing vpon that we do, and depend on him for the euent and ſucceſſe, hence will follow this peace of God, this peace of conſcience which God giueth, which our Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of. For albeit theſe things be not preciſely the cauſe of our peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but our reconciliation with God, yet we ſee the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, that this peace ſhall follow theſe things, to keepe our hearts and minds in Chriſt Ieſus.

                     </gap>eing then this is the fruite which the Lord maketh to follow thereupon, let vs hearken to the exhortation of our Apoſtle, let vs be nothing carefull, but in all things, &amp;c. and then the peace of God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that this peace is called <hi>the peace of God,</hi> hence I obſerue the author of our peace of conſcience, which is God through Chriſt. Whereunto the Apoſtles giue witneſſe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of their Epiſtles almoſt, when they pray for grace and peace vnto the Churches to which they write, from God the Father, and from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that is, from God who giues it in, through, and for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is that God is often called <hi>the God of peace,</hi> becauſe he is the author of our peace; and that Chriſt is called <hi>our peace,</hi> becauſe through him we haue peace. And why is God ſaid to be the author of our peace through Chriſt? Euen becauſe by Chriſt he hath reconciled vs vnto himſelf; as the Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth where he ſaith,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18.</note> that <hi>God hath reconciled vs vnto himſelfe by Ieſus Chriſt. For God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was in Chriſt, and reconciled the world vnto himſelfe, not imputing their ſinnes vnto them.</hi> This is it that makes our peace of conſcience, euen our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God; we know that Gods wrath is appeaſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, that the partition wall which was betweene God and vs is broken downe, that God hath receiued vs into grace and fauour through Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, and therefore all is at peace within, our ſoule and conſcience is quiet and free from all feare and care. There is a peace of the world, when we are quiet and free from troubles, warres, and the like: but what is this peace vnto that other? Though we want this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, and haue that inward peace, we haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt peace and quietneſſe that may be: but if there want this
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:599:491"/> inward peace, what outward peace ſoeuer there be, what peace is there? Surely where the want of this peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, there is alreadie a torment of hell.</p>
                  <p>If then they of <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> made ſo great account of that outward peace,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 12.20.24.2.3.</note> that by all meanes they deſired it of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod:</hi> and if the <hi>Iewes</hi> hauing obtained great outward quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes through <hi>Felix,</hi> acknowledged it wholy, and in all places, with all thankes; what prayers ought we to make vnto our God for this inward peace of conſcience; and feeling it in our owne ſoules and conſciences, how thankfully ought we to acknowledge it vnto our God? Surely for this grace and peace, we ought to offer vp the calues of our lips in a ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiuing, yea to giue vp our whole bodies a liuing ſacrifice, holy and acceptable vnto God, which is our reaſonable ſeruing of God. Seeing then that we haue this peace of all peaces through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it wholly, and in all places, with all thankes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence I obſerue the excellencie of this inward peace of conſcience which God giueth vnto his children, it paſſeth all reach of mans vnderſtanding. For in mans reaſon and vnderſtanding, who more wretched then the children of God? With whom is God more diſpleaſed then with his owne children? They are hated, reuiled, perſecuted, afflicted: they are ſcorned, impriſoned, baniſhed, and made the worlds wonder. So that as it was prophecied of Chriſt, that he ſhould be iudged as plagued, and ſmitten of God, and humbled; ſo the world iudgeth of faithfull Chriſtians, that they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued and puniſhed of God for their ſins and their iniquities. And they thinke they haue good reaſon ſo to iudge. And if it be anſwered, that though their outward man be diſquieted yet in that they haue peace of conſcience, they haue quietnes enough: they cannot skill of this, what this inward peace ſhould be which ſhould giue them ſuch quietnes. That a man when he is reuiled ſhould bleſſe, when he is perſecuted ſhould ſuffer it, when he is euill ſpoken of ſhould pray, when he hath nothing, ſhould be as if he poſſeſſed all things, when he may ſeeme to haue cauſe of deſpaire, ſhould abound in hope, when he is in tribulation ſhould reioyce in tribulation,
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:599:492"/> and all through the inward peace of their conſcience by their reconciliation with God, this is a thing which ſeemes as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to them as any thing can be, this knowledge is too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and excellent for them, they cannot attaine it: it is without the compaſſe of their vnderſtanding, they cannot tell what to make of it. And therefore ſaith our Sauiour vnto his diſciples,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Peace I leaue with you, my peace I giue vnto you, not as the world giueth, giue I vnto you.</hi> Nay, the world knoweth not that peace which God giueth vnto vs, but calleth that peace which indeed is no peace, crying, Peace, peace, when their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction haſteth vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach Gods good children to ioy and reioyce in that peace of conſcience which God hath giuen them through Chriſt. It is a grace of God which the wicked of the world feele not, nor know what it meaneth, and which the world neither can giue, nor take away from vs. If we haue this we haue all, howſoeuer we ſeeme to want all: and if we want this, we want all, howſoeuer we ſeeme to haue all. If we haue this peace within vs, we haue God with vs, and therefore howſoeuer the diuell rage, and all the world ſay all maner of euill ſayings, and practiſe all maner of wickednes againſt vs, yet herein we may reioyce, and herein let vs reioyce.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, hence I obſerue a teſtimonie and a plaine proofe for the perſeuerance of Gods children in the faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Ieſus. For the peace of God ſhall keepe their hearts and minds in Chriſt Ieſus, as ſaith the Apoſtle. If we our ſelues were left vnto our ſelues to keepe our ſelues in Chriſt Ieſus, quickly might we fall from Chriſt, and depart away from our liuing God. But not we our ſelues, but the peace of God and the God of peace ſhall keepe vs in Chriſt I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. How then ſhall he fall, that is thus kept from falling? Againe, if it were onely ſaid, that we are kept in Chriſt Ieſus, the queſtion might haply be the greater; albeit it be in truth out of queſtion, that he whom the Lord keepeth ſhall neuer fall: but it is ſaid, that the peace of God ſhall keepe vs as garriſon ſouldiers keepe their Citie from the inuaſion of any enemie. So that the peace of God and the God of peace ſhall be vnto vs as a garriſon of ſouldiers to keepe vs in Chriſt
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:599:492"/> Ieſus, that we fall not away from him. And being thus kept, how ſhall we fall? Againe, what is it that not we our ſelues but the peace of God ſhall keepe, and that thus ſtrongly? Is it our bodie, or our goods? No, theſe are not the things wherein our ſaluation conſiſteth. For though theſe periſh, yet our ſaluation may be ſure with our God. But the peace of God ſhall preſerue our hearts whereby we beleeue vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and our minds, the ſubiect of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, he ſhall keepe them in Chriſt Ieſus, that we fall not from him. He ſhall preſerue our hearts free from inordinate affections, that we may truſt perfectly on the grace of God: he ſhall preſerue our minds from wicked cogitations, that we may abound in the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: he ſhall preſerue euen both in Chriſt Ieſus, that in neither we fall from him. For if either our hearts onely be ſound, and our minds corrupt, then is our faith in vaine; or if our minds one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſound, and not our hearts, then our knowledge is in vaine. But he ſhall preſerue euen both in Chriſt Ieſus, that neither there be zeale without knowledge, nor knowledge without zeale, but that we abound and continue. Shall then not our ſelues, but the peace of God preſerue and keepe as ſtrongly as may be, not our bodies or goods, but our hearts and minds in Chriſt Ieſus, that we fall not away from the faith and knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus? And is not here euidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for our perſeuerance in grace, if we be carefull for nothing, but in all things, &amp;c? Theſe things ſhould and might haue bene enlarged.</p>
                  <p>The comfort which hence may ariſe vnto the godly, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the tongue, or pen, or vnderſtanding of any man. I muſt leaue it vnto the meditation of euery godly ſoule. Onely with the Apoſtle now I ſay vnto you, <hi>be nothing carefull, &amp;c.</hi> and then aſſure your ſelues of the conſequent, that <hi>the peace of God, &amp;c.</hi>

Whereunto the Apoſtle alſo ioyned the conſequent or effect which ſhould follow the abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of worldly and diſtruſtfull carefulnes, and the repoſing of our ſelues in God by prayer; which is, that <hi>the peace of God which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, ſhall preſerue our hearts, &amp;c.</hi> His firſt exhortation vnto perſeuerance was, leſt they ſhould ſuffer themſelues to be ſeduced and drawne from the truth which he had taught them, by thoſe falſe teachers which were crept in amongſt them. His ſecond exhortation vnto a Chriſtian ioy, was, leſt they ſhould ſuffer themſelues to be daunted or diſmayed when perſecution, or affliction, or any other croſſe ſhould befall them. His third exhortation vnto a patient moderation in their whole life and behauiour, was, that all men ſeeing their patient and gentle mind, might thereby the rather be brought to glorifie God, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus. His fourth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the laying aſide of too too worldly carefulneſſe,
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:599:493"/> and the repoſing of our ſelues in God by prayer with giuing of thankes, was, to direct them in a Chriſtian courſe for all the things of this life, and the euent of all things they had to deale withall. His adioyning of the conſequent or effect which will follow vpon it, was the rather to induce them to take that Chriſtian courſe whereunto he directed them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Furthermore, whatſoeuer things be.)</hi> After ſuch diuerſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of the Apoſtle vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> as we haue heard, the Apoſtle now, for a generall concluſion of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, exhorteth them generally vnto whatſoeuer thing is good in the life of man, that as they had bene taught by word and by example, ſo they would frame their liues to the rule of all holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Some generall heads of things the Apoſtle pointeth at, as things true, things honeſt, things iuſt, things pure, things worthy loue, things of good report; but, not ſtanding vpon any of them, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer things are of any of theſe kindes, and generally, whatſoeuer beſides theſe is vertuous and commendable, which they had eyther heard him teach, or ſeene him do: adding withall this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thereunto, that ſo the God of peace ſhould be with them. When he ſaith, <hi>Furthermore,</hi> it is as if he had thus ſaid, Not to ſtand vpon farther particulars, which would be too tedious, let me for a generall concluſion of my exhortations at this time vnto you, onely put you in minde of ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heads of Chriſtian duties, which I would haue you to thinke on, and to do; and then beſeech you beſides to think on, and to do whatſoeuer beſides them hath the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any vertue; and whatſoeuer is praiſe-worthy, euen whatſoeuer ye haue learned, &amp; receiued, and heard, and ſeene in me. Firſt then, he commendeth vnto them <hi>whatſoeuer things are true,</hi> exhorting them to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer things are true; true in opinion, that they may be free from errour; true in word, that they may be free from leaſing; true indeed, that they may be free from all hypocriſie and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; whatſoeuer things are indeed any way true, he would haue them to thinke on them, and to do them. Secondly, he commendeth vnto them <hi>whatſoeuer things are honeſt,</hi> or as the
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:599:494"/> word rather ſignifieth, whatſoeuer things do ſet them out with an holy grauity, exhorting them to think on, and to do whatſoeuer things haue in them a reuerent and comely gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, that what things are graue and comely for their perſons, they may ſay and do; and ſuch things as are light and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming them in attire, or geſture, or word, or deed, they may flie and anoyd. Thirdly, he commendeth vnto them, <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer things are iuſt, &amp;c.</hi> exhorting them to thinke on, and to do, whatſoeuer things are iuſt, that euery man may haue his right of them, and that which is due vnto them, that no man may be def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>auded by them, that as they would haue others to do vnto them ſo they may do vnto others. Fourthly, he commendeth vnto them <hi>whatſoeuer things are pure,</hi> exhorting them to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer things are pure, that in their liues they may be vnſpotted, and in their words and deeds vndefiled, being cleanſed from all filthineſſe of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit. Fiftly, he commendeth vnto them <hi>whatſoeuer things pertaine to loue,</hi> or whatſoeuer things may make them louely, exhorting them to thinke on, and to do, whatſoeuer things may make them louely, and winne them loue and fauour with all men, yet ſo with men, that with God alſo. Sixtly, he commendeth vnto them <hi>whatſoeuer things are of good report,</hi> exhorting them to thinke on, and to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things are of good report amongſt men, that by ſuch things they may purchaſe to themſelues a good report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, and be free from ſuch ſpeeches and cenſures as things of euill report might eaſily bring vpon them. Laſtly, hauing thus pointed at theſe generall heads of Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, generally he commendeth vnto them, whatſoeuer thing beſides theſe hath in it commendation of vertue or matter of praiſe, exhorting them, that if beſides theſe things alreadie ſpoken of, <hi>there be any vertue,</hi> that is, any thing which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th in it commendation of vertue, or, <hi>if there be any praiſe,</hi> or any thing praiſe-worthy with good men, they ſhould thinke on, euen ſeriouſly and aduiſedly theſe things, letting thoſe things of ceremony to paſſe which the falſe teachers vrged. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that he might the rather perſwade them; firſt, he tells them, that theſe things which now he commendeth vnto
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:599:494"/> them, and whereunto now he exhorteth them, are no new things, ſuch as they neuer knew nor heard of, but ſuch as both they had learned by hearing, and receiued by inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and heard at his mouth, and ſeene in him, in the practiſe of his life: and therefore, as before he willed them to thinke on them, ſo now he willeth them to do them, that knowing them, and doing them, they might haue the full commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. Secondly, he promiſeth them, that if thus they ſhall thinke on, and do theſe things whereunto he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, then the God of peace ſhall be with them, to giue vnto them the peace of conſcience, and a peaceable life amongſt men, ſo farre forth as may be for his glorie, and their good. This I take to be the meaning of theſe words. The bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches then into which they diuide themſelues, ye ſee, are an exhortation, and two reaſons or motiues to enforce the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. The exhortation is, to thinke on, and to do, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things are true, &amp;c. The former motiue to induce them hereunto is drawne from the things themſelues whereunto he exhorteth them, which were no new things: but ſuch as both they had learned, and receiued, and heard, and ſeene in his owne example. The latter motiue to induce them is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the God of peace ſhall be with them, if they will thinke on, and do theſe things. Thus much of the meaning of theſe words, and of the things therein contained. Now let vs ſee what notes we may gather hence for our further vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, to beginne with the moſt generall, here I note, that if there be any vertue, any praiſe, any thing that is good, any thing that is commendable, the Apoſtle would haue the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſeriouſly to thinke on it with themſelues, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to practiſe it in their liues, whatſoeuer it be. Whence I obſerue this note for vs and for all Chriſtians, that we all of vs ought to haue our hearts ſet, and our frete preſt to fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low whatſoeuer is good and commendable amongſt the ſons of men. And this is plainly proued out of the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles. Thus ſaith the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.14. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11.</note> and out of him the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Eſchue euill, and do good,</hi> neither of them inſiſting vpon any particular good, but exhorting or
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:599:495"/> commanding to do good, euen whatſoeuer is good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.15.</note> So our Apoſtle, <hi>Euer follow</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that which is good, both toward your ſelues, and toward all men.</hi> Where the Apoſtle would haue the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſo farre from recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing euil for euill vnto any man, that he would haue them forward and ready to do whatſoeuer is good vnto all men. It is then ye ſee a duty required of vs, to follow whatſoeuer is good and commendable,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17.</note> or as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure things honeſt in the ſight of all men.</hi> And if we muſt needes haue motiues to draw vs on to this dutie, becauſe otherwiſe we are too too dull and ſlow, behold what the Apoſtle ſaith to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.10.</note> 
                     <hi>To euery man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that doth good, ſhall be glorie, and honour, and peace.</hi> But what ſhould other motiue need then this, that whatſoeuer is good, is onely good by participation with God, who alone is good, as our Sauiour tells vs,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Iames</hi> 1.17.</note> then ſurely vnleſſe we will in ſome ſort renounce God, we muſt embrace and follow what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is good, euery thing that is good, hauing the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed image of God in it, ſo farre as it is good.</p>
                  <p>Only we muſt take heed, leſt as the Serpent be guiled <hi>Eue,</hi> through his ſubtiltie, vnder a ſhew and colour of good, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading her that that was good, which indeed was euill; ſo the world or the diuell deceiue vs vnder a ſhew and colour of good, and perſwade vs that that is good which is not, that that is praiſe-worthie which is not. For not that which the world iudgeth to be good is alwayes good, but that onelie which the Lord alloweth for good in his word: neyther is that alwayes praiſe-worthy which the world praiſeth, but that onely which the Lord praiſeth. It is good (ſaith the world) to ſaue a mans life, though it be by a lie, or by periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and if a man frame himſelfe to the faſhion of the world, the world praiſeth him. But doth the Lord either approue him for good,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8.12.2.</note> when he reproueth them that do euill, that good may come thereof? or praiſe the other, when he doth by his Apoſtle tenderly beſeech vs not to faſhion our ſelues
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:599:495"/> like vnto the world? We muſt then look vnto the thing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good and commendable, and ſuch as the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth for good and commendable. And if it be, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be, we ought in our hearts to embrace it, in our liues to practiſe it, and with eagre liking to follow after it. Neither let any man thus ſay with himſelfe, There are ſome good and commendable things which I could like very well to thinke on and to do, but that they are in ſuch requeſt and liking with the Papiſts, or with ſome that otherwiſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and wicked men. For whatſoeuer is good, in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be, we are to loue it, and to like it.

                        <hi>Acts</hi> 8.24.</note> requeſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to pray vnto the Lord for him, I will take this leſſon from him, to requeſt the prayers of the faithfull for me, when I haue ſinned againſt my God. We may not communicate with any either in any ſuperſtition, or in any vnfruitful works of darkeneſſe. But whatſoeuer is good, if it be indeede truly good, we are to thinke on it, and to do it; we are to loue it and to like it, and to make it a preſident for vs to follow in whomſoeuer it be.</p>
                  <p>Let this then firſt teach vs to abſtaine from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of euill. For thus we are to reaſon with our ſelues; Are we to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer is good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable? Then whatſoeuer is euill and blame-worthie, we are not to thinke on, nor to do. That which is good, is onely to buſie all our thoughts, and to take vp all our actions: but whatſoeuer is euill, is not once to enter into our thoughts, much leſſe may it be the worke of our hands. The Prophet ſpeaketh of a generation of men that imagine miſchiefe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their beds, and ſet themſelues in no good way,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.4.</note> neyther abhorre any thing that is euill. It were well there were no ſuch at this day, whoſe inward thoughts are very wickednes, whoſe workes are onely euill, whoſe wayes tend wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. But generally this is true, that men very well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet ſmell of ſome caske or other: either they are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:599:496"/> or proude, or ambitious, or vnmercifull, or contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or partially affected, or the like. We do not thinke on, and do whatſoeuer is good, we do not waſh our hands of whatſoeuer is euill, but one bad thing or other there is which ſo haunts euery one of vs, that we alwaies carry it in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome with vs. Well, we ſee whereon our thoughts ſhould be ſet, and whereabout we ſhould be occupied: whatſoeuer is good, whatſoeuer is commendable, we ſhould think on that, and do that; and he that inſtructeth vs in this dutie, withall doth imply, that whatſoeuer is euill, ſhould not once enter our thoughts, much leſſe ſhould be the trade of our way. Let vs therefore follow that which is good, and abſtaine from all appearance of euill; let vs as many as feare the Lord depart from iniquitie, and let our ſoules delight in whatſoeuer is good and commendable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this teach vs, wiſely to conſider our wayes, what is indeed and truly good and commendable. For not whatſoeuer thing ſeemeth vnto vs, or is thought by others to be good and commendable are we exhorted here to think on, and to do, but to think on, and to do whatſoeuer is indeed and truly good &amp; commendable. It is thought in ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, nay I may ſay it is thought among vs (for vnto a high degree of exceſſe are we growne that way,) that to bowze &amp; carowſe, to quaffe cup after cup, and to beare his drinke wel, is a very commendable thing. Here then we are to look whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be indeed commendable. For if it be, then we are to do it by our Apoſtles rule in this place. But what ſaith the Spirit?<note place="margin">

                     <hi>and to them that are ſtrong to powre in ſtrong drinke:</hi> If thou exceed
<pb n="827" facs="tcp:599:496"/> in drinking, thy ſinne is drunkenneſſe, how well ſoeuer thou beare thy drinke, and a woe is vnto thee. I inſtance onely in this ſinne, becauſe this ſinne hath ſo much dared to braue it ſelfe amongſt vs. But as in this, ſo in many other things it may be found, that howſoeuer they be thought commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet indeed they are not. Let vs therefore looke vnto the thing that ſeemeth vnto vs, or is thought by others to be good and commendable; and if it be indeed ſuch, ſo that it haue allowance from the Lord in his word to be ſuch, then let vs thinke on it, and do it. But in any caſe let not the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world ſo ſway with vs, as that vpon the worlds word we thinke on, and do whatſoeuer ſeemeth good and commendable vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let this teach vs to ſuppreſſe that conceit of not following ſomething which is good, becauſe it is in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt with them which otherwiſe are not good. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is good, if it be indeed good, in whomſoeuer it be, we are to loue it, and to like it, to thinke on it, and to do it. What needes it to will any of vs to take vp a peece of golde, though it be out of a dung-hill? Howſoeeur therefore the man be ſuperſtitious, looſe of life, profane and wicked, yet if there be any good thing in him, let vs not diſdaine it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it becauſe of him, but let vs obſerue it, and thinke on it, and do it. If there be any vertue, any praiſe, any thing that is good, any thing that is commendable indeed, whereſoeuer it is, let not that cauſe vs to balke it, but let vs thinke on it, and do it. And let this ſuffice for the generall, of thinking on, and doing whatſoeuer is good and commendable. Now come we to the generall heads of ſuch good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things as the Apoſtle commendeth vnto the <hi>Philippians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, then here I note that the Apoſtle would haue the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſeriouſly to thinke on, with themſelues, and diligently to practiſe in their liues, whatſoeuer things are true. Whence I obſerue this note, for vs, and for all men, that whatſoeuer things are true, we are to thinke on them, and to do them. Is it a truth in religion? We are to embrace it, and profeſſe it; as we ſee our Apoſtle was not diſobedient to the heauenly viſion which appeared to him in the way, but hauing
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:599:497"/> the eyes of his vnderſtanding opened by the Lords Spirit, he ſtraitway preached Chriſt in the ſynagogues,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 9.20.</note> &amp; profeſſed the truth in all integritie and ſimplicitie. Is it a truth in the words of our mouth? We ought euery man to ſpeake the truth vnto his neighbour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.16.</note> as <hi>Zachary</hi> willeth ſaying: <hi>Speake euery man the truth vnto his neighbour;</hi> and after him the Apoſtle ſaying, <hi>Caſt off lying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.25.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſpeake euery man truth vnto his neighbour.</hi> Is it a truth in our deeds and in the waies of our life? We are to be as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.47.</note> 
                     <hi>true Iſraelites in deed in whom is no guile,</hi> &amp; not to make ſhew of one thing, and in truth to be another thing. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer truth it is, it ought to be ſo precious vnto vs, as that with the Apoſtle we ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.</note> 
                     <hi>We cannot do any thing againſt the truth, but for the truth;</hi> we cannot hold of errour againſt the truth, we cannot lie to falſifie the truth, we cannot diſſemble to make ſhew of others then the truth is we are. Let this one reaſon for this time ſerue to preſſe this point. Chriſt is truth, as himſelfe ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.6.</note> 
                     <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life;</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſpake was truth, and for the truth, for <hi>no guile was euer found in his mouth:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.</note> we are the ſonnes of him who is truth; that is, of God; we are redeemed by him who is truth; that is, by God: we are regenerate and borne againe by the Spirit of truth, we are called to the knowledge of the truth, and ſo we ſhall dwell with God for euer if we ſpeake the truth from our heart. As then we will haue him who is true, and truth it ſelfe, to be our God, and our ſelues to be his people and heires of his kingdome, we are to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer things are true.</p>
                  <p>Are we then to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer things are true? Firſt, let this teach vs to take heede and beware of errours in religion, whereby the truth of the Goſpel of Chriſt Ieſus is peruerted. Whoſoeuer ſaith it, if it be a truth, it is to be maintained; but if it be an errour from the truth, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaith it, it is to be reiected. If Fathers, Councels, Church, and all ſay it, if it be an errour, what is that to me? But if it be a truth, be it Arrian, or Lutheran, or Papiſt, or Proteſtant that ſaith it, what is that to me? No authoritie may giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to an errour, neither may any mans perſon or profeſſion preiudice a truth; but whatſoeuer is true, we are to thinke on
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:599:497"/> it, and do it; whatſoeuer is erroneous, we are not to thinke on it, nor to do it. What ſhall we ſay then vnto them that wholly build vpon the Church, the Church, and euer runne on vs with open mouthes, the doctrine of the Church, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church; and this Church forſooth is the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> What ſhall we ſay vnto them that hauing laid downe and taught a truth, afterwards perceiuing themſelues therein to concurre with <hi>Caluin,</hi> did therefore reuoke it, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the truth into an error? We ſay vnto them as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaid vnto the Iewes in his time:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.19.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Should not a people enquire at their God? To the law, and to the teſtimonie, if they ſpeake not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> The thing that we aske, is, what is a truth according to the word, what is an errour from the word? not what the Church teacheth, or what <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaith. If they can ſhew that the things which their Church teacheth are true, we profeſſe our willingneſſe to embrace whatſoeuer things are true; and if <hi>Caluin</hi> ſay the truth, why ſhould they reiect it becauſe he ſayeth it? Learne you to diſcerne betweene truth and error; and looke not ſo much who ſayeth it, as whether it be true or erroneous that is ſaid. If the Church, or ſome ſpeciall profeſſors of the truth, agree vpon a truth, it may verie well ſway with vs. But howſoeuer men ſay, a truth in religion is therefore to be receiued becauſe it is a truth, and an error therefore to be reiected becauſe it is an errour. If it be a truth receiue it, if an errour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, are we to thinke on and to do whatſoeuer things are true? Let this then teach vs to put away lying out of our mouthes. Whatſoeuer things are true, we are to ſpeake them in their due times and places: but whatſoeuer things are lies and falſhoods, there is no time or place for the ſpeaking of them. For all lying is of the diuel, and he is the father thereof.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.25.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeeing that ye haue put off the old man with his workes:</hi> and againe, <hi>Caſt off lying, &amp;c.</hi> And yet ſee how men loue rather to lie then to ſpeake truly; as if they had rather runne with the diuell, then walke in truth with God. One deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately lyeth in deſpite of the truth, and boaſteth himſelfe of his lying. Another lieth, hoping ſo to conceale his ſins as he hath fallen into, and ſo addeth iniquitie to iniquitie. Another lieth, but it is forſooth in ieaſt, and he meaneth no harme by his lying. And another lieth, but it is forſooth greatly for the behoofe and good of his friend, or elſe he would not doe it. Thus lying, which the Lord ſo much hateth, euery where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth. And though none indeed can, yet ſome thinke they may pleade pardon for their lying. The deſperate lier, it may be hopeth not for, nor reckoneth vpon any pardon. He hath made a couenant with death, and with hell he is at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. And what pardon he hopeth for, I know not, that to conceale his other faults and ſinnes, alſo lieth. But if two ſinnes be not to be bound together, becauſe in one we ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, then what hope of impunitie when vnto other ſinnes is added alſo lying? Now for lying in ieaſt, no man, I thinke, will ſay that it is either a leſſe fault, or more pardonable then an idle word: and yet we ſee our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour tels vs,<note place="margin">

For grauitie in all theſe things is not more beſeeming, then any ſuch lightneſſe is vtterly vnbeſeeming in any man. To ſee a Miniſter weare this ſhagge and ruffian like haire, which is too too common among all ſorts of men; to ſee him turne himſelfe into euery cut, and euery new faſhion of apparell that comes vp, or to heare him bring into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit riming ſtuffe and ſcurrile ieaſts to moue laughter: To ſee a Magiſtrate drinking &amp; carowſing among boon companions, or dancing about a may-pole, or running into ſuch folly as he ſhould reſtraine in others: To ſee an ancient matron mincing her treadings, or tricking and trimming her ſelfe like vnto one of the yonger ſort, or any way wantonly carying her ſelf: to ſee a yong woman ful of talk, or much abroad in the ſtreets, or familiar with others then of her owne ſexe: to ſee a ſcholler courting yong women, or frequenting tauernes, innes, or ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, or ſporting himſelfe any way laſciuiouſly: generally to ſee a man more gariſh in his attire and apparell, more nice in his gate and geſture, more vaine in his talke and ſpeech, more vnreuerent in his actions and deeds then is meet for his place and calling; how vnbeſeeming is it? how diſgracefull is it to their perſons that offend any of theſe wayes?<note place="margin">

For here, in my iudgement, is one very great cauſe of that want of reuerence which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where. We complaine greatly, and not without iuſt cauſe, of great want of reuerence in the yonger ſort towards their elders and their betters in their places: but certainly here is one great cauſe of it, we our ſelues euery man in his place, walke not in that grauitie that beſeemeth our perſons; we are not of that diſcreete and ſeemly cariage which ſhould win reuerence vnto vs in our places: but not conſidering our ſelues one way or other, we bewray that vanitie, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that fooliſhneſſe, and oftentimes that boyiſhneſſe in our ſelues, which cauſeth want of reuerence, and bringeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt vnto our perſons. Well, ye ſee our Apoſtle would haue vs to thinke on and to do whatſoeuer things are graue, and decent, and beſeeming our perſons in our places. Let vs hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto our Apoſtle, and let vs euery man conſider himſelfe, and do that which is graue and beſeeming vs in our places. Let vs auoide both in our apparell, and in our geſture, and in our talke, and in our deeds, whatſoeuer may bewray any kind of lightneſſe in vs. So ſhall we do that which in this point we ought, and ſo ſhall we recouer that reuerence which we haue loſt.</p>

Secondly, becauſe the things which may iuſtly be required of vs, do indeed make vs debters vnto them that may require them of vs. For haue we counſell, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning, ſtrength, &amp;c?

Yet how much do we profane it, as throughout the whole yeare, ſo eſpecially at this time of the
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:599:501"/> yere, by bringing in our may-poles, by hauing our ales, by that moſt diſorderly trunke-playing, by rifling, by bowling, and diuers other kinds of gaming; by our ill cuſtomes of riding, going, drinking, dancing, and many the like offenſiue things on that day? If we muſt needs haue theſe things, ſome of which are heatheniſh, and the reſt no way neceſſary and little better, yet let vs ſpare the Lord his day, let vs conſecrate that day, and therein our ſelues vnto him. We haue other ſinnes too many, though we do not adde this vnto them of profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lord his day. Let vs remember what the Lord in this iuſtly requireth of vs, and let vs not defraud him of this due.

How bitter are the husbands ſometimes towards their wiues, and how vndutifull are they againe towards their husbands? How cockering are parents of their children, and how ſtubborne are children towards their parents? how negligent are tutors? how diſſolute are ſchollers? how careleſſe are they that owe, to repay that they owe? and how ready are they that lend to grate vpon them to whom they lend? How many men in the Miniſterie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud their Churches of that which is due vnto them? and how many of the reſt defraud the Common-wealth of that which is due vnto it? To ſpeake all in one word, how few of all ſorts thinke on and do that which might iuſtly be required of them? Well, ye ſee the Apoſtle would haue vs to thinke on and to do whatſoeuer things may iuſtly be required of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs in our place. Let vs therefore euery one of vs
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:599:502"/> conſider our ſelues in our place, and let vs ſee what thing it is that may iuſtly be required of vs. Not one of vs all but we ſhall find many things which the Lord our God, which our ſoueraigne Prince, which our neighbours and brethren may iuſtly require of vs. Not one of vs all, but we ſhall find many things which by the law of Nature, by the law of Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by the law of God, by the law of man, may iuſtly be required of vs. Let vs therefore euery one of vs thinke of theſe things, and let vs all of vs in our place do whatſoeuer may iuſtly be required of vs. Let our care be not to defraud any, God or man, Prince or people, neighbour or brother, one or other of that which is due vnto him, but whatſoeuer things are iuſt let vs thinke on them, and do them. So ſhall we do that which we ought, and ſo ſhall the wrath of the Lord which is kindled againſt vs, be turned away from vs. It followeth:</p>

Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that whatſoeuer things are pure and cleane from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and of the ſpirit, we are to thinke on them, and to do them. The Scribes and Phariſees thought on and obſerued an outward puritie, and cleanneſſe of the body; for they would not eate till firſt they had waſhed their hands.<note place="margin">

They remember not that their tongues were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them therewith to glorifie the God of heauen, but as if their tongues were their owne to ſpeake therewith what they liſt, therewith they deſpite the Lord, offend their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18.</note> and defile themſelues. Againe, <hi>Flie fornication</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle;) <hi>euery ſin that a man doth is without the bodie, but he that committeth fornication ſinneth againſt his owne bodie.</hi> And yet how do men defile their bodies in all places with the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this ſinne? Know we not (beloued) that our bodies are the members of Chriſt? or if we do, ſhall we take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot? God forbid. Know we not that he which coupleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with an harlot, is one body with her? And ſhall we ioyne our ſelues vnto an harlot, &amp; cut off our ſelues from the body of Chriſt Ieſus? God forbid. Know we not that our bodies are the temples of the holy Ghoſt to dwell in? And ſhall we by following after ſtrange fleſh driue the holy Ghoſt out of the temples of our bodies?<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.</note> God forbid. <hi>If any man deſtroy the temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy.</hi> Now what do we elſe but
<pb n="841" facs="tcp:599:503"/> deſtroy the temple of God, when we make our bodies a cage of vncleane birds, and of all hatefull luſts and pleaſures? It behooueth therefore euerie man to looke into himſelfe, how he ſuffereth himſelfe to be defiled with this vncleanneſſe, that he keepe his body a pure virgin vnto the Lord.

Thus inſtead of hearkning vnto the Apoſtles exhortation we mock and reproch them that endeuour to keepe themſelues pure. Well, ye ſee that our Apoſtle would haue vs to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer things are pure. Let vs hearken vnto the Apoſtle, and let vs labour and ſtriue vnto it, both by praier, and euerie holy courſe, to be pure in body and in ſoule, in word and in deede, and in our whole man.

                     <hi>Whatſoeuer things pertaine to loue:</hi> This is the fift generall head of that Chriſtian dutie which the Apoſtle commendeth vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> wherein he exhorteth them to think on, and to do whatſoeuer things are louely, and may procure them loue and fauour with all men. For ſo I vnderſtand the Apoſtle in this place. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that whatſoeuer things may win vs loue and fauour amongſt men, we are to thinke on them, and to do them. It is ſaid of our bleſſed Sauiour, that <hi>he increaſed in wiſedome, and ſtature,</hi>

                     <hi>and in fauour with God and men.</hi> And it cannot but be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in vs, ſo to carrie our ſelues, as that we grow in loue and fauour amongſt men. What then? Are we to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the idolatrous in their ſuperſtitions, with the drunkards in their drunkenneſſe, with the laſciuious in their wantonneſſe, with the idle in their idleneſſe, with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts in their vnthriftineſſe, with the factious in their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, with the careleſſe in their retchleſneſſe, with the carnall in their carnalitie, that we may winne their loue and fauour? The fauour indeed of ſuch is ſeldome wonne but ſo. But it is not ſo much the loue and fauour of them, as the loue and fauor of the good and godly that we are to ſeeke. What then? Are we to ſoothe and flatter them, to ſpeake that we ſhould not, that we may ſeeke to pleaſe them; to ſpare to ſpeake that we ſhould, leſt we offend them; to hazard a good conſcience, for the pleaſing of them; or euerie way to labour to creepe into their fauour? for thus ſometimes euen their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor is won. Nay, neither are we thus to ſeeke after the fauour of good men. But ſo we are to thinke on, and to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things may winne vs loue and fauour amongſt men, as that the ſame things alſo may purchaſe vs fauour with God: For otherwiſe if they be not acceptable vnto God, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they might winne vs fauour amongſt men, we are not to thinke on them, nor to do them. What then are the things which may winne vs fauour with God and men? If we put on tender mercie, kindeneſſe, humbleneſſe of minde, meekeneſſe, long-ſuffering, patience, and temperance: if we be true in word and deede, iuſt in our dealings, helpefull to the poore, honeſt in our conuerſation, if we honour the aged, ſeeke not our owne, but the wealth of others, &amp;c. theſe are things as pleaſing vnto God, ſo ſuch as winne the loue and fauour of all men, not onely the good and godly, but alſo the wicked and vngodly. Theſe things therefore we are to thinke on and to do. And ſo our Apoſtle willeth, where he ſaith, <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>

                  <p>This ſhould teach vs to auoid the things which may bring vpon vs the hatred and obloquy of men. Otherwiſe then the maner of ſome is, who purpoſely do ſome things, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:599:504"/> they may ſpite and grieue ſome men. It is not the hatred or diſpleaſure of men that may withhold vs from ſpeaking, or doing that we ought. But if to ſpite or grieue ſome man, we ſticke not to ſpeake or do that which may diſpleaſe our God, then our iudgement ſleepeth not. If we bring vpon our ſelues the hatred of men, and withall the diſpleaſure of God, the burthen will be too heauy for vs to beare. Let vs therefore hearken vnto the counſell of our Apoſtle, and let vs thinke on, and do whatſoeuer things may win vs loue and fauour with men, ſo that withall they be pleaſing vnto God. Let vs auoide whatſoeuer things may bring vpon vs the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or diſpleaſure of men, ſpecially ſuch as are diſpleaſing vnto God. Let vs loue and liue ſo, that we may be loued of God and man; euen whatſoeuer things are louely, let vs think on them, and do them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is yet remaining another generall head of Chriſtian piety, which the Apoſtle commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> wherein he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer things are of good report amongſt men, that by ſuch things they may win vnto themſelues a good name, and be well ſpoken and reported of in the places where they liue. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that whatſoeuer things may purchaſe vs a good report, or continue our good name amongſt the ſonnes of men, we are to thinke on them, and to do them, that as much as is poſſible we may heare well of all men. <hi>A good name</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) maketh the bones fat:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prouer.</hi> 15.30</note> that is, ſo comforteth, and reioyceth, and ſtrengtheneth a man
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:599:505"/> as good fare which maketh him fat and well liking; yea, <hi>A good name</hi> (ſaith the ſame <hi>Salomon) is to be choſen aboue great riches:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">22.1. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 41.13.</note> yea, <hi>a good name is better then a good ointment. A good life</hi> (ſaith the ſonne of <hi>Syrach) hath the dayes numbred, but a good name endureth for euer:</hi> it continueth with thee aboue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand treaſures of gold. And therefore it is that men are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as iealous of their good name and good report among men as of their liues, and count themſelues (after a ſort) killed when their good name is empaired, or called into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To haue then a good name, ye ſee, and to be well repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, is as much worth as gold; nay, as a thouſand trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of gold; nay, as much worth as a mans life. Therefore the Apoſtle exhorteth to <hi>procure things honeſt before all men:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17.</note> things honeſt, that is, things which may purchaſe vs credite, and make vs to be well reported of amongſt men: And our Apoſtle in this place, to thinke on, and to do whatſoeuer things are of good report. Now then, what are the things that make vs well reported of amongſt men? Surely, if it be ſaid of vs, that we are men dealing faithfully, truly, iuſtly and vprightly; liuing honeſtly, ſoberly, purely and godly; walking wiſely, modeſtly, peaceably, and louingly with our brethren, bearing things patiently as becometh the Saints of God; in a word, hauing faith and a good conſcience, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer things pertaine to vertue: if we be ſuch men, theſe things will make vs well reported of, and either bring vs to a good name if we had it not, or continue our good name if we haue it. For theſe are things of good report, both before the Lord, and alſo before men.</p>
                  <p>Yea but this is great vanitie, to ſeek after fame &amp; good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port among men, that men may ſpeake well, and report well of vs. It is ſo indeed, if therein we ſeek our owne glorie. For how good ſoeuer, how full of rare vertues ſoeuer the things be that we do, if therein we ſeeke our owne glorie, it is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great vanitie. We muſt therefore know, that we are to thinke on, and to do the things that are of good report, both before the Lord, and alſo before men, not for our owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but for the glorie of Chriſt Ieſus in whom we beleeue, for the glorie of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, which we profeſſe.
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:599:505"/> We muſt haue care that we may be well ſpoken of, well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of, not for any tickling vanitie of our owne praiſes, but that the name of God, that the truth of Chriſt Ieſus might be well ſpoken of for our ſakes. For it is an ornament and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto the truth with men, if the profeſſors of the truth be of good report amongſt men.

                  <p>This then ſhould teach vs to take heed and beware of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things may bring an euill report vpon vs; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that the hurt thereof lights not vpon our ſelues alone, but vpon the name of our God whereby we are called, and vpon the truth of our God which we profeſſe.

And ſo muſt we reckon, that whatſoeuer ill report we bring vpon our ſelues by any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill that we do, it lights not on our ſelues alone, but vpon our God in whom we beleeue, and vpon his truth which we pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="846" facs="tcp:599:506"/> And yet how careleſſe are we of ſuch things as bring ill reports vpon vs? Factions, diuiſions and contentions, what ill reports do they bring vpon vs, and vpon the truth which we profeſſe? And yet how is the corne ouergrowne euery where by theſe weeds and tares? Euery one of vs will poſt the name off from one to another. The Browniſts and Barrowiſts they make no diuiſion in the Church; the ringleaders of factions, they make no factions in ſocieties; the firebrands of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they make no contention among neighbours and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but ſuch, and ſuch, and ſuch. But yet the thing remaineth to our great infamie; faction, diuiſion and contention, they grow vp to our ſhame. Againe, vſurie (I thinke) will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be a thing of euil report: I am ſure the Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it,<note place="margin">

And yet how many profeſſors of the truth heare euill for this ſinne? and how ill doth the truth it ſelfe heare for this ſinne? I aſſure my ſelf, that the aduerſaries of the truth offend a hundred fold more this way, then do the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the truth. But being a thing of euill report, I could wiſh that the profeſſors of the truth would with <hi>Ieremie</hi> waſh their hands of this ſin. I ſhould inſtance in many other things of euill report. But by theſe you will coniecture what is to be ſaid of the reſt. For generally this I ſay, whatſoeuer the thing be, if it be of euill report, we are not to thinke on it, not to do it, leſt not onely we, but the truth of Chriſt Ieſus heare euill for our ſakes.</p>
                  <p>Yea but what if an euill report be brought vpon vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe? What if we be counted ſchiſmaticall, factious, contentious, vſurers, or the like, without a cauſe? Without a cauſe? then no matter. If there be a cauſe of ſuch report, then we are to looke vnto it: but if not, we need not to be moued much at the matter.<note place="margin">

We cannot ſtay men from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting ill of vs. Our bleſſed Sauiour himſelfe heard it ſaid of himſelfe, that he was <hi>a glutton, and a drinker of wine,</hi>

                     <hi>a friend of Publicans and ſinners.</hi> What maruell if the world ſpeake euill of vs, and like the Dragon caſt out whole flouds of euill reports vpon vs? But this we are to looke vnto, that neither we thinke on, nor do any thing that may bring an euill report vpon vs iuſtly. For we heare what our Apoſtle ſaith; Whatſoeuer things are of good report, we are to thinke on them and to do them, but whatſoeuer things are of euill report, we are not to thinke on them nor to do them. Let vs therefore carefully looke vnto the things whereon we ſet our hearts, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we ſet our hands. Is it a thing of good report, which may make vs well ſpoken of amongſt men? Let vs then thinke on it and do it, that ſo the truth which we profeſſe may be well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. But is it a thing of euill report, which may make vs ill ſpoken of? Let euen this be enough to diſſwade vs from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on it, or doing it, whatſoeuer it be, leſt the way of truth be euill ſpoken of. By things of good report, our God, and his truth, and our ſelues ſhall haue honour: but by things of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill report, our God, and his truth, and our ſelues ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored. Let vs therefore think on and do whatſoeuer things may bring on vs a good report, and auoide both the thought and the deed of whatſoeuer may bring an ill report vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing which I note in this generall concluſion of the Apoſtles exhortations, or rather in the exhortation, is, that the Apoſtle would haue the <hi>Philippians</hi> to thinke on theſe things, and to do theſe things. For theſe two, howſoeuer they be ſeuered in place by our Apoſtle, yet are they to be ioyned in the opening of theſe words, and in following of the Apoſtles exhortation. He would therefore haue the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to thinke on theſe things, that is, to enter into a diligent conſideration of theſe things with themſelues, and in their hearts to loue and affect them, and likewiſe to do theſe things, becauſe it would be to no great purpoſe, that in their hearts they ſhould loue and affect theſe things, and enter into a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:599:507"/> conſideration of them, vnleſſe alſo they ſhould practiſe them in their liues. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that vnto the performance of Chriſtian pietie and holy dutie, it is not enough to thinke on ſeriouſly with our ſelues, and in our hearts to loue and affect whatſoeuer things are true, &amp;c. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe alſo in our outward actions we follow whatſoeuer things are true, &amp;c. Both in our hearts we muſt thinke on, and loue, and affect the things that are good; and in the words of our mouth, in the workes of our hands, and in the wayes of our liues, we muſt ſhew forth the ſame. Heart and hand muſt go together. If the heart endite a good matter, the tongue muſt be the pen of a readie writer: if the heart beleeue vnto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, the tongue muſt confeſſe vnto ſaluation: and if the knowledge of ſuch things as accompanie ſaluation be in the vnderſtanding, there muſt alſo be an holy practiſe of ſuch things in the life and conuerſation. And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.14.</note> that both the meditations of his heart and the words of his mouth might be acceptable in the ſight of the Lord; no doubt, that both in his heart he might thinke on, and with his mouth might ſpeak, and in his life might practiſe thoſe things which were good and right in his eyes. And in another place he profeſſeth,<note place="margin">119.</note> not onely that he loueth the law of the Lord, &amp; meditateth therein continually, but alſo that he keepeth his commandements with his whole heart. For as our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Not euery one that ſaith vnto me, Lord, Lord ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doth the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heauen:</hi> and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Not the hearers of the law are righteous before God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13.</note> 
                     <hi>but the doers of the law ſhall be iuſtified:</hi> ſo is it likewiſe in this whereof we now ſpeake, that not euery one that thinketh on, or loueth and affecteth the things that are good, by and by performeth the holy duties of Chriſtian pietie, but he that ſheweth forth his loue in the holy practiſe of a Chriſtian life and conuerſation. Nay, indeed whatſoeuer profeſſion we make, and howſoeuer we ſay that we thinke on, and loue and affect the beſt things, yet vnleſſe the fruite thereof ſhew it ſelfe in our outward actions, in our liues and conuerſations, in vaine do we perſwade our ſelues of Chriſtian pietie in our ſelues. For where the Spirit worketh
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:599:507"/> in the heart a ſerious cogitation, a true loue and affection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whatſoeuer things are good, there alſo by the power and worke of the ſame Spirit the fruite of theſe things is ſeene in the practiſe of a holy life and conuerſation: ſo that as we thinke on, and loue, and affect the things that are good, ſo we will be readie alſo to do and to practiſe that which is good.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs to take heed how we flatter our ſelues with a vaine perſwaſion of Chriſtian pietie and performance of holy dutie, when indeed we are farre from it. Thou wilt ſay vnto me, that thou thinkeſt on the things that are true, and holy, and iuſt, &amp;c. as much as any man doth: but thou muſt ſay it and proue it, or elſe howſoeuer thou perſwadeſt thy ſelfe of thy performance of a good Chriſtian dutie in that thou thinkeſt on, and loueſt, and affecteſt the things that are good, yet thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. For ſay that thine heart is ſet on, and that thou haſt a very good mind vnto whatſoeuer things are true; thou muſt alſo proue it by doing whatſoeuer things are true, by embracing a truth in religion, by ſpeaking the truth with thy mouth, and by being that in truth, which thou wouldſt ſeeme vnto the world to be, or elſe thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. Say that thou loueſt and affecteſt whatſoeuer things are honeſt, thou muſt alſo make proofe of it by doing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer becometh thy perſon in thy place, with all decent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, or elſe thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. Say that thine heart is ſet on whatſoeuer things are iuſt; thou muſt make proofe of it by doing whatſoeuer things may be iuſtly required of thee by God or man, or elſe thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. Say that thine heart is ſet on whatſoeuer things are pure; thou muſt alſo make proofe of it by abſtaining from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and of the ſpirit, or elſe thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. Say that thine heart is ſet on whatſoeuer things are louely; thou muſt alſo make proofe of it, by doing whatſoeuer may winne thee loue and fauour with God and men, or elſe thou decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt thy ſelfe. Say that thine heart is ſet on whatſoeuer things are of good report; thou muſt alſo make proofe of it by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoeuer may make thee wel reported of, and the truth for thy ſake, or elſe thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. Say that thine heart is ſet on whatſoeuer things are good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="850" facs="tcp:599:508"/> thou muſt alſo make proofe of it by doing whatſoeuer things are good and commendable, and abſtaining from the contrary, or elſe thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe. And therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great many of vs doe deceiue our ſelues. For by our outward actions it appeareth how farre otherwiſe we doe then we ſhould, lying one vnto another, doing things not ſeemly, defrauding others of that is due vnto them, defiling our owne ſelues, grieuing one another, bringing vpon our ſelues euill reports, and following after that which is euill &amp; blame worthy. We would (it may be) ſerue God, but we do ſerue Mammon: we would (it may be) ſeeme religious, but we are couetous: we crie (it may be) in our hearts, and with our mouthes, Lord, Lord; but we do not the wil of the Lord: we would ſit (it may be) at the right hand and left hand of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in his kingdome, but we cannot away with it to drinke of his cup. In a word, we would make a ſhew of godlineſſe, but we denie the power thereof; we would ſeeme to profeſſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but we do turne the grace of God into wantonnes. Thus we deceiue our ſelues while we do not both thinke on, and do the things that are good, and ſuch as accompanie ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Let vs therefore as many as feare the Lord, and deſire to walke in his wayes, hearken vnto our Apoſtle, and both thinke on and do whatſoeuer things are true, &amp;c. He that hath made all, and is onely worthy of all, let him haue all: heart and hand, thought and deed, word and work, let all be employed in his ſeruice, let all be alwayes bent vnto whatſoeuer things are true, &amp;c. that ſtill we thinke on them and do them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which ye haue both learned, &amp;c.</hi> This is the former reaſon which the Apoſtle vſeth to enforce his exhortation vnto the <hi>Philippians;</hi> and it is drawne, as ye ſee, from the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he exhorteth them, which were no new things, ſuch as they had not knowne or heard of, but which they had both learned, and receiued, and heard, and ſeene in him. Where I note, that the things whereunto he exhorteth them, were ſuch as they had both learned, and receiued, and heard, and ſeene in him, and therefore ſuch as both he might the better vrge, and they ſhould the rather follow. Whence firſt I obſerue this leſſon for the Miniſter and teacher of the word, that if he wil
<pb n="851" facs="tcp:599:508"/> do good with his people, and preuaile with them vnto euery holy courſe, he muſt both teach them with the word of truth and with example of life, that both they may heare &amp; learne the truth from his mouth, and likewiſe ſee the ſame expreſſed in his life. And therefore our Apoſtle exhorteth <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>be an example vnto them that beleeue, in word and in conuerſation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.</note> in word, that from his mouth they might be inſtructed in the wholeſome word of truth; and in conuerſation, that in his life they might ſee that integritie which becometh Saints. So likewiſe he exhorteth <hi>Titus, Aboue all things to ſhew himſelfe an example of good workes, with vncorrupt doctrine, with grauitie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.7.8.</note> 
                     <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, and with the wholeſome word that cannot be reproued:</hi> ſo that he would haue him both to teach the truth ſoundly and ſincerely, and in his life to carry himſelfe with all grauitie and integritie, to be a patterne of good works &amp; holineſſe of life. And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth all Miniſters to <hi>feede the flocke of God which dependeth on them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.3.</note> and to be <hi>examples</hi> to the flocke; to feede them with the bread of God, the wholeſome word of truth, and to be examples vnto them in all holineſſe of life. Otherwiſe, whatſoeuer they build with the one hand, they pull downe with the other; and like vnto the naughtie cow, turne downe with their foote all the milk that they haue yeelded. For preach they neuer ſo well, labour they neuer ſo painfully, be they neuer ſo eloquent and mightie in the Scriptures, if their life be offenſiue, their teaching will be vnprofitable. Nay, if their people can once ſay vnto them, <hi>Phyſition heale thy ſelf; Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? Thou that preacheſt, A man ſhould not ſteale,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21.22.</note> 
                     <hi>doeſt thou ſteale? Thou that ſayeſt, A man ſhould not commit adulterie, doeſt thou commit adulterie?</hi> Let them neuer looke to preuaile with them for any thing that is good. O but the people ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what their teachers ſay, not what they do. True indeed; for ſo our Sauiour hath ſaid. But the teachers ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as of that they ſay, ſo of that they do, to leade their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in and out, both in ſoundneſſe of doctrine and in holineſſe of life. For as a woe is vnto them if any periſh for want of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſo likewiſe if any periſh by their ill and naughtie exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of liuing.</p>

He that faileth in either, doctrine or life, hath his wo; how much more he that faileth in both?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence I obſerue this leſſon for you that are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the word, that whatſoeuer good things ye haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, receiued, heard, and ſeene in your Miniſters and teachers, thoſe things ye ſhould thinke on and do.

Yes beloued: if we be to bring the Goſpell of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vnto you, ye are to receiue it of vs: if we be to ſhew you all the counſell of God, ye are to heare it of vs: if we be to go before you in a ſanctified life, ye are to follow vs, and ſo to walke as ye haue vs for an example.<note place="margin">

How ought we then to be receiued of you, and how ought our meſſage to be entertained?</p>
                  <p>But do ye hearken vnto vs as vnto your fathers in Chriſt Ieſus? Do ye receiue vs as the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt Ieſus? Is our meſſage entertained as ſent from Chriſt Ieſus? I beare you record, ſome of you, that ye receiue our meſſage, and hearken vnto vs gladly. But if all of you ſhall ſay that ye do ſo, then muſt I ſay vnto you as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> told him, that he had fulfilled the commandement;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.14.</note>

If we come vnto you, and ſpeake vnto you in our owne name, heare vs not: but if we come vnto you, and ſpeake vnto you in the name of the Lord, will ye not heare vs?

We onely, as the Lord his watchmen, warne you of the wickedneſſe of your wayes: we onely, as the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt Ieſus, pray ye that ye be reconciled vnto God. If ye hearken not ſin lyeth at the doore, indignation and wrath is vnto them that diſobey the truth. Beloued, it is not yours, but you that we ſeeke. It is not out of the humour of one that can abide no paſtime that we ſpeake vnto you, but out of the deſire of one that would haue you blameleſſe and pure, and the ſonnes of God without rebuke. In Chriſts ſtead therefore I beſeech you to leaue off theſe diſordered ſportings and meetings. The cuſtome of them is heatheniſh, the abuſes of them great, and the inconueniences which follow them, many. Thus ye haue learned, and receiued, and heard; and therefore thinke not on them, nor do them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE latter reaſon which the Apoſtle vſeth to enforce his exhortation, remaineth now to be ſpoken of, which is a promiſe, that the God of peace ſhall be with them, if they will thinke on theſe things, and do them. The thing then that vpon hearkening vnto his exhortation is promiſed, is, the preſence of the onely wiſe and euerliuing God, ſometimes called the God of glorie, in whom onely is the fulneſſe of glorie, and vnto whom all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is due; ſometimes the God of loue, in whom onely is true and perfect loue, and who alone is for himſelfe to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; ſometimes the God of comfort and conſolation, in whom, and by whom alone we haue true comfort vnto our ſoules; ſometimes our peace, which of Iewes and Gentiles hath made one bodie, and broken downe the partition wall which was betweene vs and them; ſometimes the King of peace, vnder the couert of whoſe wings we liue in peace; and ſometimes the God of peace, as both here, and often elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Now he is called the God of peace, both becauſe of our reconciliation which he hath wrought by Ieſus Chriſt: for ſo it is ſaid,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18.</note> that <hi>he hath reconciled vs vnto himſelfe by Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and becauſe of that peace of conſcience which he communicateth vnto vs through our reconciliation with him by Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note> for ſo it is ſaid, that <hi>being iuſtified by faith, we haue peace towards God through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and likewiſe becauſe of that outward peace which he giueth vs in the world, ſo farre forth as is for his glorie, and our good. When then the Apoſtle ſaith, that the God of peace ſhall be
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:599:511"/> with them, the fruit of Gods preſence with them is thereby ſignified, in that he is called the God of peace. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thus I vnderſtand this promiſe, that if they thinke on, and do theſe things which he hath commended vnto them, then the God of peace ſhall be with them to reconcile them vnto himſelfe, to giue them peace of conſcience through their reconciliation with him, and to bleſſe them with outward peace in the world, ſo farre forth as ſhall be for his glorie, and their good, ſo that the fruit of their innocencie and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhall be peace, inward and outward, with God, in their ſoules, and in the world.</p>
                  <p>Where firſt, in that the Apoſtle, the rather to enforce his exhortation, annexeth this mercifull promiſe, that in ſo doing, the God of peace ſhall be with them, I obſerue the great mercie of our God toward vs, who to winne vs to the performance of ſuch Chriſtian dueties as we owe vnto him and to our brethren, doth both in his owne perſon, and in his Miniſters, draw vs thereunto, by moſt ſweete and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing promiſes. If we looke into the worke of our creation at the beginning, we ſhall finde that we were created, formed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.7.</note> and made for the glorie of God, that we might glorifie him by doing his will, and walking in his wayes. If we looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worke of our recreation by Ieſus Chriſt, we ſhall find that <hi>we are treated in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10.</note> 
                     <hi>which God hath ordained that we ſhould walke in them.</hi> If we looke into the written Law of God, we ſhall finde, that whatſoeuer things are true &amp;c. we ought to thinke on them, and to do them. So that by the law of our creation, by the law of our recreation, by the holie law of God we are to do whatſoeuer Chriſtian dutie may iuſtly be required of vs by God, or man; and when we haue done all that we can in any of theſe things, we haue done no more but that which was our duety to do,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10.</note> euen that which, as we are Gods workemanſhip, we are bound to do. And yet ſuch is the mercie of our God, as that to bring vs vnto ſuch Chriſtian duties as we are bound to performe, he makes many large and great promiſes, both by himſelfe, and by his Miniſters. In <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

Yet behold by how many and great promiſes of bleſſings he inuiteth them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7.</note> In our Apoſtle likewiſe, <hi>To them that by continuance in well doing ſeeke glorie, and honour, and immortalitie, God ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eternall life.</hi> To continue in well doing, is a duty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are bound.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.10.</note> For ſo it is written, <hi>Curſed is euerie one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Booke of the Law to do them:</hi> Yet behold, to prouoke vs hereunto, a promiſe of eternall life. Quite otherwiſe then it is with vs: for which of vs, to draw our ſeruants to the performance of ſuch duties as by their places they are to do, allure them by promiſes? Nay, we require of them that which is their dutie to do, and looke for it at their hands. But promiſes, they are for children. But as in other things, ſo is it in this, God is not as man. He hath giuen vs a Law to keepe, and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vs duetie, to obſerue, which we his ſeruants are to keepe and obſerue, and the performance whereof he may abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely require of vs. Yet doth he not ſo, but by many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of great rewards he prouoketh vs vnto whatſoeuer he requireth of vs, as might be proued by infinite teſtimonies out of the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould ſerue to ſtirre vp our dull mindes, and to make vs follow hard toward whatſoeuer holy duties, towards God, or towards man, are required of vs. That we muſt be allured by promiſes, argues our dull mindes and vnwilling to the things that are good, vnleſſe we be euen drawne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by promiſe of reward. But in that we are allured by promiſes, let this ſtirre vs vp to follow after ſuch holy duties as haue ſuch promiſes of reward from the Lord. If the world do promiſe honour, there needes not any to ſpurre the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious forward: ſo is it with the ſenſuall man, if the fleſh do promiſe pleaſures; and ſo is it with the couetous, if the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any winde do promiſe riches; they make haſte, and
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:599:512"/> poſte apace after theſe things, and ſtriue who ſhould be the foremoſt. Shall the promiſes of the world, of the fleſh, or of any like thing ſo ſtirre vp the ambitious, ſenſuall, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous worldlings to runne after their vanities; and ſhall not the promiſes of the Lord ſtirre vp his children to follow after ſuch things as haue ſuch promiſes of reward from him? Shall the words of winde and worſe ſo preuaile with them to run after, I ſay not after a corruptible crowne, but after worſe then vanitie; and ſhall not the word of the Lord preuaile with his children to runne after ſuch holy duties as bring with them an incorruptible crowne? It is a ſhame that the children of darkneſſe ſhould thus ouergo the children of light in their generation. Let not the vaine promiſes of the world preuaile more with them to draw them vnto worldly vanitie, then the ſure promiſes of the Lord with vs to draw vs vnto Chriſtian pietie. Let vs not deſpiſe the mercie of the Lord, but, as dutifull children, let vs follow after that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by louing promiſes, he doth ſo prouoke vs, as parents are wont to do their children. If he onely required it, we were to do it. How ought we then to beſtirre our ſelues when he promiſeth great bleſſings for doing that we ſhould? Let vs then hearken when he promiſeth, and ſurely waite for what he promiſeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the thing promiſed, in that it is ſaid that the God of peace ſhall be with them, to giue them peace out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward, with God, in their ſoules, and in the world, if they will thinke on, and do thoſe things whereunto he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them; I obſerue what the fruit of innocencie, pietie, and holy walking with God and men is; the God of peace ſhall be with ſuch as ſo walke to giue them his peace. Be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be of good comfort, be of one minde,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11.</note> 
                     <hi>liue in peace, and the God of loue and peace ſhall be with you.</hi> In which words the Apoſtle in few words compriſeth the ſumme of that Chriſtian pietie and duty which he requireth of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians;</hi> and withall ſheweth that this fruit ſhall follow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the performance thereof, the God of loue and peace ſhall be with them, that his loue being ſhed abroad in their hearts by the power of the Spirit, they may be fulfilled with that
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:599:513"/> peace which paſſeth all vnderſtanding. Will we then haue the Lord to be preſent with vs by his grace? Will we haue the God of peace to be with vs to giue vs his peace? Then muſt we liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world; and whatſoeuer things are true, whatſoeuer things are honeſt, whatſoeuer things are iuſt, &amp;c. we muſt thinke on them, and do them. For ſo the God of peace ſhal be with vs if we walke with God, and with men as we ought, thinking on &amp; doing ſuch things as are good, &amp; accompany ſaluation. Where withall we muſt know that this fruite of Gods preſence, this bleſſing of peace by the God of peace, followeth not vpon the merit and worth of any performance of any Chriſtian piety or duty which we can thinke on or do: for, could we do more by much then we are able to do, yet ſhould we do but that onely which is our duty to do, as before I told you. And where nothing but duty is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, what merit is there for the performance? Nay, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer good we do, or poſſibly can do, it is ſo polluted by the filthineſſe of the fleſh and of the ſpirit wherewithall we are defiled, that if it be weighed, it will be found too light in it ſelfe to deſerue any good at the Lords hand. Not one ſtraight line that we draw, but all our paths are crooked, and <hi>all our righteouſneſſe is as filthy clouts:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.6.</note> So that no merite but of death which is the due reward of ſinne.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</note> How then is it that this fruit, of Gods preſence, this bleſſing of peace by the God of peace followeth our performance of Chriſtian piety? It is not of merite, but according vnto promiſe. For as in this place ye ſee, he hath promiſed ſuch fruite to follow ſuch holy wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. He then which hath promiſed, being not as man that he ſhould lie, or as the ſonne of man that he ſhould repent, but being faithfull in his promiſe, giueth ſuch grace where there wanteth merit, euen becauſe he hath promiſed. And if we keepe the condition, the promiſe ſhall ſurely be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; if we thinke on and do theſe things which we haue heard and learned, then the God of peace ſhal ſurely be with vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſo promiſed. Do I ſay, if we keepe the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we thinke on, and do theſe things which we haue heard and learned? Yea I ſay ſo: but here ſee the mercie of God.
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:599:513"/> He impoſeth a condition vpon vs, he requires a duty of vs, to thinke on, and do theſe things. And what, is it in vs to keep the condition? is it in vs to thinke on, and do theſe things? Nay, our Apoſtle plainly telleth vs,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> that <hi>we are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing that is good, as of our ſelues, but our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> Ill enough we can thinke of our ſelues: for in our ſelues <hi>all the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts are onely euill continually:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſis</hi> 6.5.</note> but we cannot thinke any thing that is good as of our ſelues. What, not thinke? How then can we do the thing that is good? Our Apoſtle tells vs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</note> that <hi>it is God that workes in vs both the will and the deede, euen of his good pleaſure:</hi> So that if we deſire any thing that is good, or do any thing that is good, it is God that workes in vs, both the good deſire, and the good deed. To the point then, the Lord impoſeth a condition vpon vs, and he alone enableth vs to the performance of the condition; he requireth of vs to think on, and to do thoſe things which are true, honeſt, iuſt, &amp;c. and he alone ſuggeſteth vnto vs both the thinking on, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things; and he ſaith vnto vs, If ye walke in my Lawes, &amp;c. and be alone maketh vs to walke in his Lawes, and worketh in vs whatſoeuer thing is good. So that when the Lord maketh good his promiſes vnto vs, and crowneth vs with rich graces according to his promiſe, he onely crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and graceth his owne workes which he hath wrought in vs. Thus then ye ſee, that ſo the God of peace ſhall be with vs if we thinke on, and do whatſoeuer things are true, &amp;c. not that eyther the merit of our Chriſtian and holy walking procureth that promiſe of the Lord, or that it is in vs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the condition, that ſo we may receiue the promiſe. But it is the Lord that worketh in vs both to thinke on, and to do theſe things, and that bindeth himſelfe by promiſe to be with vs, if we thinke on, and do theſe things: and therefore, if we thinke on, and do theſe things, he will be with vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Hence then let vs learne what ſhall be vnto them that do do not thinke on, nor do whatſoeuer things are true, &amp;c. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen whatſoeuer things they haue learned, and receiued, and ſeene in their Miniſters and Teachers, namely this, The God
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:599:514"/> of peace ſhall not be with them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 48.22.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no peace</hi> (ſayth the Lord) <hi>to the wicked.</hi> And againe, <hi>The wicked</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>ſhall be turned into hell,</hi>

                     <hi>and all the people that forget God.</hi> Now, who forget God, if not they that do not thinke on and do the things that they haue learned, and receiued, and heard, and ſeene in Gods Miniſters? Nay, it cannot be that the God of peace ſhould be with them that ſo neglect the things that belong to their peace. For them that honor him he will honour,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30.</note> and they that deſpiſe him ſhall be deſpiſed. Ioyne light and darkeneſſe, Chriſt and <hi>Belial;</hi> and then let the God of peace be with them that neglect the things that belong vnto their peace. And yet how many are there that will not come to learne, &amp; receiue, and heare of vs the things that belong vnto their peace? how many that neuer thinke on, or do the things that they haue learned, and receiued, and heard of vs, the things that are true, honeſt? &amp;c. The abſence of ſome (for the moſt part) from theſe our holie meetings, and the diſſolute negligence of others, which being preſent, are as if they were abſent, giue too too plaine teſtimonie to the truth of that I ſay. O would we haue the God of peace to be with vs! who is ſo deſperately wicked that would not? Here we ſee how we may haue the God of peace to be with vs, namely, if we thinke on and do thoſe things which we haue learned, and receiued, &amp; heard of our teachers in Chriſt Ieſus. But if eyther we ſhall oppoſe our ſelues vnto thoſe things, as ſome do; or neglect to thinke on and do thoſe things, as too many do; or abſent our ſelues from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and learning, and receiuing of thoſe things, as others do, how ſhall the God of peace be with vs? Nay, he ſhall ſet himſelfe againſt vs, and in ſtead of peace with him and in our owne ſoules, he ſhall arme himſelfe againſt vs, and ſend trouble into our ſoules. Let vs therefore thinke on, and do whatſoeuer things are true, &amp;c. euen whatſoeuer good things we haue learned, and receiued, and heard, and ſeene in our Miniſters and Teachers: and let vs take heed how either we oppoſe our ſelues vnto them, or neglect to thinke on, and do them, or abſent our ſelues from the hearing of them. If we do, the God of peace ſhall be with vs to giue vs his peace.
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:599:514"/> but if not, he will ſet himſelfe againſt vs; and howſoeuer for a time we ſleep ſecurely, yet ſhall he make vs at warre againſt our ſelues. Thus farre of this exhortation, and the reaſons hereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now reioyce I alſo, &amp;c.</hi> After thoſe ſundrie exhortations vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Philippians</hi> in the former part of this Chapter, whereof hitherto we haue ſpoken, now followeth the latter part of the Chapter, wherein he giueth thankes vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> for that bountifull liberalitie which they ſent vnto him lying at <hi>Rome</hi> in priſon, by the hands of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> their miniſter, therewith to ſupply ſuch things as he lacked. Firſt therefore he ſignifieth his reioycing for their great care for him, ſhewed by the things which they ſent him by their miniſter, verſ. 10. Secondly he ſignifieth his reioying to be, not ſo much for the gift they ſent him, as for the fruite which thence redounded vnto them, from ver. 11. to 18. Thirdly he commendeth their liberalitie, and wiſheth the recompence thereof into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, verſ. 18, 19. Theſe be the generall points. Firſt then he ſignifieth (I ſay) his reioycing for their great care for him, when he ſaith, <hi>Now reioyce I, &amp;c.</hi> In that he ſaith, <hi>I reioyce greatly,</hi> he ſignifieth the greatneſſe of his reioycing, that he was almoſt rauiſhed with ioy for their care for him. In that he ſaith, <hi>I reioyce greatly in the Lord,</hi> he ſignifieth that his ioy was not carnall, or conceiued vpon the greatneſſe of the gift, but that the Lord by his Spirit had enlarged their hearts, and wrought in them ſuch a Chriſtian care. In that he ſaith, that <hi>now at the laſt they were reuiued again to care for him,</hi> he implieth that their care had for ſome time ſlacked towards him. The word here vſed is borrowed from trees, which ſeeming in Winter to be dead and withered, in the Spring grow greene againe; and hath in it this ſimilitude, that as the trees which in Winter ſeemed to be withered, flouriſh againe in the Spring, ſo their care which for a time languiſhed and decayed, now againe reuiued. In that laſtly he ſaith, that they <hi>had bene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp;c.</hi> he excuſeth the ſlackneſſe of their care for him, as not proceeding from want of will, but from want of oportunitie to ſend that which they deſired. In theſe words then I note theſe three branches: firſt, the Apoſtles reioycing for their
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:599:515"/> care for him: ſecondly, the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſlackneſſe for ſome time to care for him: thirdly, the Apoſtles excuſe of their ſlacknes to care for him. This is the meaning of theſe words, and theſe be the branches therein contained. Now let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence, whereof to make ſome vſe for our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then here I note the Apoſtles great thankfulnes vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> for their great care of him, whereof he giueth them to wit, when he ſaith, that he reioyceth greatly for their care for him. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for all Chriſtians, that it becometh them to be thankfull for benefits receiued, and to ſhew forth their thankfulnes in word and in deed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe of whom they haue receiued them. I ſpeake not of thankfulnes vnto God, but of thankfulnes vnto men, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming all men, as that otherwiſe almoſt they forget to be men.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Philem.</hi> 5.</note> And how thankfully doth he remember <hi>Philemont</hi> loue towards all Saints? Generally that of the Prophet is true euen in this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.1.</note> that <hi>it becometh well the iuſt to be thankfull,</hi> as vnto the Lord for his mercies, ſo vnto man for ſuch benefits as they haue receiued of man. For thus both he that receiueth, ſhall do that which might be expected; and he that giueth, ſhall haue that wherewith he will be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs to beware of vnthankfulnes. <hi>He that rewardeth euill for good,</hi>

Let vnkind <hi>Laban</hi> be vnthankfull vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> if he will, and churliſh <hi>Nabal</hi> vnto <hi>Dauid;</hi> but let it be farre from the faithfull to be vnthankful.

Whoſe fault ſoeuer it be, it is a foule fault, and one that includes all. Let vs beware of it, and let our thankful mind be knowne to all, that any way deſerue well of vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, that he reioyced in the Lord greatly for their care for him, I note, that the Apoſtles reioycing was not ſo much for the bountifulnes of their gift, but eſpecially for that the Lord by his Spirit had enlarged their hearts to a Chriſtian care ouer him. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that when any do relieue vs being in priſon, pouertie, need, ſickneſſe, or any other aduerſitie, we are not ſo much to reioyce in the gift by which we are relieued, but eſpecially we ought to reioyce in the Lord for that he hath vouchſafed to touch their hearts with a godly feeling of our wants, and a Chriſtian care to ſupply our wants. Thankfulnes vnto them is beſeeming and requiſite, as before we heard; but our ſpeciall care ſhould be to lift vp our eyes vnto the Lord, and to reioyce in him. For he it is that openeth the bowels of compaſſion, &amp; toucheth with a tender commiſeration of their poore and needie diſtreſſed brethren, the hearts of them that are enriched with greater ſufficiencie. And therefore our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in many of his Epiſtles vſually thanketh God as for their faith in Chriſt Ieſus, ſo for their loue towards all Saints:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 1.3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>We giue thankes to God euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in the next Epiſtle, <hi>ſince we heard of your faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and of your loue towards all Saints.</hi> And he tels the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that their <hi>liberalitie cauſeth thanksgiuing vnto God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11.</note> God being therefore to be bleſſed, becauſe he openeth the Saints hearts to relieue the neceſſities of the poore Saints.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore let me beſeech you, beloued, euen in the bowels of Chriſt Ieſus, to giue your poore and diſtreſſed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren cauſe to reioyce in the Lord greatly for your care ouer them. A godly and Chriſtian care of late hath bene taken by the whole States of the land aſſembled in Parliament for the prouiſion of the poore; and we are all of vs to reioyce in the Lord greatly for it, that he put into their mind ſuch an holy
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:599:516"/> care. Put ye now on tender mercie and compaſſion, and let your care likewiſe be ſhewed this way, by a chearfull giuing towards the reliefe of your poore brethren ſo much as ſhalbe thought meete for you, that the backes and bellies of your poore brethren may bleſſe you, and reioyce in the Lord for you. If ye ſhall find in your ſelues a willing chearfulneſſe this way, know that it is the Lord that hath opened your hearts, &amp; ſtirred vp the bowels of compaſſion within you, and looke whatſoeuer he giues, the Lord ſhal recompence it into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 19.17.</note> For ſo it is written, <hi>He that hath mercie on the poore, len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Lord, and he will recompence him that which he hath giuen.</hi> But if ye ſhall grudge to ſet forward ſo good a worke, and think euery litle too much that is required of you to that purpoſe know that the Lord hath yet hardened your hearts, and ſhut vp all bowels of compaſſion within you; and as now the poore crie, and ye heare not, ſo the day ſhall come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye ſhall crie,<note place="margin">21.13.</note> and not be heard. For ſo it is written, <hi>He that ſtoppeth his eares at the crying of the poore, he ſhall alſo crie, and not be heard.</hi> As euery man therfore hath receiued, ſo let him giue, and that chearfully:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.</note> 
                     <hi>For God loueth a chearfull giuer.</hi> So ſhall the loines of the poore bleſſe you, ſo ſhall they reioyce in the Lord greatly for you, and ſo ſhall the Lord make all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to abound towards you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let me exhort them of the poorer ſort, to learne to reioyce in the Lord for the care which he ſtirreth vp in their brethren for them. It is too too commonly ſeene in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, that as ye want the wealth of the world, ſo ye want alſo the grace of God. Ye ſit and beg almes and reliefe. If ye haue it not, ye murmure and grudge, oftentimes ye banne and curſe: if ye haue it, ſome of you take it, and go your wayes, and there is an end; others of you ſay ſome formal words from the teeth forward: but who is he, or where is he that hauing receiued reliefe, lifteth vp his eyes vnto the Lord, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in him, for that it hath pleaſed him to worke in their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſuch a Chriſtian care ouer them? Who is he or where is he, that being ſent away without reliefe, lifteth vp his eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and prayeth vnto him, that it will pleaſe him to increaſe their brethrens care ouer them, and to giue them
<pb n="865" facs="tcp:599:516"/> bowels of compaſſion towards them, without murmuring or grudging at them? Thus ſhould ye do, and then ſurely the hearts of many that are yet hardened, would be opened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. Learne therefore as to be thankfull towards your brethren for their care ouer you, ſo principally to thanke the Lord and to reioyce in him for the care which he ſtirreth vp in them for you. Learne to thinke on him, to bleſſe him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in him more then any great many of you do. Looke not onely to the reliefe which ye receiue, but looke vnto the Lord, whoſe worke it is to incline mens hearts to relieue you. Thus ſhall he be well pleaſed, and thus ſhall he incline men more and more to relieue you.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next thing which I noted in theſe words, was the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſlackneſſe to care (for ſome time) for the Apoſtle. For in that he ſaith, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, &amp;c. that now at laſt ye are reuiued, &amp;c.</hi> he implieth, that their care had for ſome time ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked towards him; the word here vſed being borrowed from trees, which ſeeming in Winter to be dead, flouriſh againe in the Spring: and hauing in it this ſimilitude, that as trees which in Winter ſeeme to be dead and withered, flouriſh and grow greene againe in the Spring; ſo their care which for a time lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and decayed, now againe reuiued and quickened in them. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for our learning, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the faithfull and deareſt children of God, loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and other good graces of Gods Spirit, are not alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like orient and eminent, not alwayes alike manifeſt and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but ſometimes they languiſh and decay, and are as if

So ſubiect vnto their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are both whole bodies, and the ſoundeſt parts euen of the beſt bodies, ſo long as they are clothed with the earthly houſe of this tabernacle. Not the beſt, but feele ſuch decayes in themſelues; not the beſt, but the beſt graces are ſo eclipſed in them, that they which ſhould be as trees planted by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of waters, bringing forth their fruite in due ſeaſon, are ſometimes as dead and withered trees whoſe leaues are faded and their fruite periſhed; that their faith which ſhould worke by loue, is ſometimes as fire vnder the aſhes or embers; that their charitie which ſhould alwayes be feruent, is ſometimes ice-cold; that their obedience which ſhould be with their whole heart, is ſometimes diuided betweene God and the world: ſo that not the beſt but may ſometimes ſhrinke in himſelfe, and others doubt of him whether he belong to the couenant, whether he be in the ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>But it is a doubt which need not greatly trouble. For though the children of God may ſometimes ſeeme to be as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet are they not as the wicked. The wicked are indeed like the heath in the wildernes, they are indeed corrupt trees, and without fruite, twiſe dead, and pluckt vp by the rootes. For though ſome of them be, it may be, as the fig-tree which Chriſt curſed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 21 19.</note> hauing leaues and ſhadowes, and ſhewes, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers good graces of Gods Spirit; yet looke well vpon them, and conſider them, and ye ſhall find that either they haue no fruite, or naughtie fruite on them, wanting all ſappe and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Gods holy Spirit in them. But the children of God
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:599:517"/> onely ſeeme for a time to be as dead and withered trees, as doth in Winter euery faire and pleaſant tree. For though now their leaues be faded, yet do they afterward grow greene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; though now they beare no fruite, yet afterward they do; though now there ſeeme to be no ſap or moiſture in them, yet is there in the roote, and afterward ſhootes out; though now they be as dead, yet afterwards they reuiue again. Their faith and loue are ſometimes raked vp as it were in the aſhes; but infidelitie is bound vp in the ſoule of the wicked, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred eateth vp the bowels of their belly. Their charitie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſom times cold, and their obedience full of defect; but the very bowels of the wicked are mercileſſe crueltie, and they ſell themſelues to worke iniquitie: or if there be any vtter rine or barke, to make ſemblance and ſhew of a good tree, yet is there no ſap or moiſture of Gods holy Spirit in them. Wel they may haue taſted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, but it is but a taſte that they haue gotten, and the fruite that followeth it, is but a bloſſome. But the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are taught by Gods Spirit; and howſoeuer for a time the Spirit ſhew not it ſelf in them, yet doth it afterwards bud forth into the fruits of true righteouſneſſe and holineſſe. To ſpeake all in one word, the wicked reuiue not after they ſeemed to be dead, becauſe in truth they neuer liued; but the children of God after that they ſeeme to be dead vnto the life of God, at laſt reuiue againe, and do their former workes: and againe, the wicked onely for ſome time ſeeme to liue, and at laſt ſhew plainly that they are and alwayes were dead in ſinne; but the children of God onely for ſome time ſeem to be dead, and at laſt reuiue againe vnto the life of God, through the power of the Spirit which was neuer quite quenched in them.</p>
                  <p>Here then is both a word of comfort vnto the diſtreſſed, &amp; a watch word likewiſe vnto all in generall. A comfort it muſt needs be vnto the afflicted ſoule, that in the deareſt children of God, the life of God is not alwayes ſo manifeſt, but that ſometimes they ſeeme to be dead, yet at laſt do reuiue again, and do their former workes. For why art thou ſo full of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe, O thou diſtreſſed ſoule, and why are thy thoughts ſo troubled within thee? Art thou euen dead in reſpect of the
<pb n="868" facs="tcp:599:518"/> life of God? Feeleſt thou no warmth of the Spirit within thee? Art thou cold in zeale, cold in prayer, cold in charitie? Haſt thou ſlacked that diligence which thou waſt wont to vſe in the ſeruice of thy God, in thy dutie towards thy neighbours and brethren? Well, plucke vp thine heart, be not troubled nor feare. This is no other thing then ſometimes befalleth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the deareſt children of God: for ſometimes euen the beſt of them feele it to be ſo with them. Onely tell me this: didſt thou euer feele the life of God and the warmth of his Spirit within thee? Hadſt thou ſometimes comfort in the hauing of thoſe graces, the want whereof doth now diſquiet and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort thee? O what elſe? and there is thy griefe that now thou findeſt not that comfort in them which thou waſt wont to find. Well, be ſtrong, and comfort thine heart. For thy God at the laſt will reuiue thee. Thy God will ſtabliſh the thing that he hath wrought in thee; and he that hath begun a good worke in thee, will performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt: for whom he loueth once, he loueth vnto the end. A cloud hath for a while ouerſhadowed thee, and Satan for a time by a miſt hath obſcured thy light: but thy light ſhall breake forth, though not as the Sunne in his brightneſſe, yet ſo cleare that the life of thy God ſhall be manifeſt in thee.</p>
                  <p>Onely let this watchword be vnto thee, and vnto all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that when you feele ſuch decayes of the life of God in your ſelues, either by dulneſſe vnto any dutie, or ſlackneſſe in any ſeruice, then ye ſtirre vp the grace of God in you, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by prayer and euery holy courſe, that the grace which ſeemeth to be dead, may be reuiued in you. As therefore the Apoſtle exhorteth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14.</note> ſo ſay I vnto you, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand vp from the dead,</hi> euen them that are dead in ſinne and iniquitie, <hi>and Chriſt ſhall giue thee light.</hi> Shake off that drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which hath ſeized vpon you, and ſtir vp euery good grace of God in you. Quench not the Spirit that is within you, but ſtriue to grow vp in grace and euery good gift of the Spirit. Is your loue towards Gods Saints abated in you?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9.</note> Hearken to the Apoſtle, <hi>Be affectioned to loue one another with brotherly loue and let</hi> your <hi>loue be without diſſimulation</hi> and pray alwayes vnto the ſtrong God of your ſaluation, that your loue may abound
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:599:518"/> daily towards all Saints. Yea, whatſoeuer good grace is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in you, giue all diligence that it may be reuiued in you, and labour thereunto by all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing which I noted in theſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, was the Apoſtles excuſe of the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſlackeneſſe to care for him. For, in that he ſaith, <hi>Wherein notwithſtanding ye were carefull, but ye lacked oportunitie:</hi> he interpreteth their ſlackneſſe to care for him to proceed, not from want of good will towards him, but from want of oportunitie to ſend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that which they deſired. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that we are not alwayes ſharply to cenſure the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of our brethren in faith, loue or other vertue; but rather charitably to iudge of them, and ſo much as in a good conſcience we may, to ſalue and excuſe them by a kinde and fauourable interpretation. Not the beſt but they haue their infirmities, through which (ſometimes) they ſo fall that they ſeeme almoſt to be dead, as already we haue heard, both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to do ſuch things as they ſhould do, and committing ſuch things as they ſhould not do: but many cauſes there may be of ſuch failing in the performance of Chriſtian dutie. A defect there may be of zeale, yet proceeding rather from feare of diſturbing the peace of the Church, then from want of enflamed deſire to ſee the houſe of the Lord, wall &amp; roofe builded vp in perfect beautie. A defect there may be of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, yet proceeding rather from want of oportunitie then from want of will to performe that dutie. And ſo in other things, cauſes ſometimes may be preſumed to be of ſuch and ſuch faults which may excuſe the faults. And therefore we are charitably to iudge of the faults of our brethren, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in charitie preſume of that excuſe for them which may be alledged, then by ſharpe cenſure to condemne them whom the Lord hath not condemned.</p>
                  <p>Where yet we muſt haue theſe caueats, firſt, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not that to be euill which is euill, that to be ſinne which is ſinne; as they do that denie <hi>Abraham</hi> to haue lied, when he ſaid of <hi>Sarah, She is my ſiſter:</hi> that deny <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to haue ſworne when ſo often he proteſted vnto his brethren by the life of
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:599:519"/> 
                     <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> that denie <hi>Peter</hi> to haue ſinned (at the leaſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally) when <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood him to his face; and they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that ſay of pride, it is cleanlineſſe; of couetouſneſſe, it is thrift; of deceit and fraud, it is wiſedome; of hypocriſie, it is curteous humanitie; of laſciuious wantonneſſe, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite cheerefulneſſe, and the like. For this is not charitably to beare with a fault, charitie being, as not ſuſpicious, ſo not fooliſh, to denie that to be euill which is euill; neyther is it to excuſe, but onely by a lie. The ſecond caueat is, that we do not farther excuſe the faults and infirmities of any then in a good conſcience we may: For if through fauour or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or how elſe ſoeuer we do ſo, what good ſoeuer we ſhall do thereby vnto others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſurely we ſhall do great wrong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our owne ſoules: and howſoeuer haply we brooke it for a time,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 15.15.</note> yet in the end ſhall it ſting like a Serpent. <hi>A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a continuall feaſt.</hi> But if in any mans behalfe, or to any purpoſe we ſhall do more then in a good conſcience we may, the end thereof will be bitter as gall and wormwood.</p>
                  <p>Here then are three ſorts of men to be reproued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; firſt, ſuch as vpon euerie ſlip of their brethren, and euery blemiſh wherwith they can be tainted, are ready ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cenſure them, and by their cenſure to condemne them whom the Lord hath not condemned:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Who art thou</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that condemneſt another mans ſeruant? he ſtandeth or falleth to his owne maſter.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2.1.</note> Yea, <hi>and in that that thou iudgeſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, thou condemneſt thy ſelfe: for thou that iudgeſt, doeſt euen the ſame things,</hi> or the like that thou condemneſt in others. Let vs not therefore be haſtie to cenſure or condemne one another for euery fault, but let vs beare one with anothers infirmities. Let vs iudge of our brethren after the rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, euen as we would haue others to iudge of vs when we fall through infirmitie. There is one that iudgeth both them and vs; let vs commit all iudgement vnto him that iudgeth righteouſly; and in the meane time, thinke rather the beſt, then the worſt, as charitie bids vs, then as our ſence might leade vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here are to be reproued and condemned, ſuch as with too too light and ſlight termes paſſe ouer notorious
<pb n="871" facs="tcp:599:519"/> and groſſe faults. For a generation of men there is, that to the end forſooth that they may ſeeme charitable in their iudgements towards their brethren, ſpeake good of that which plainly is euill, and interprete that vnto the beſt which in plaine euidence is ſinfull and wicked. What? muſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be a foole? As ſhe is not ſuſpicious, ſo ſhe is not fooliſh; as ſhe will not eaſily thinke the worſt, ſo ſhe will not ſuffer her ſelfe to be abuſed. For if when a man ſhould be preſent at the Sermon he be ordinarily bowling, or carding, or drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, muſt I in charitie thinke that he hath neceſſarie occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of abſence? Or when a man willingly and wittingly runs himſelfe vpon the rockes by breaking the wholeſome Lawes of God, or of man, am I vncharitable if I interprete not his actions vnto the beſt? Nay rather he miſdeemeth of charitie that ſo thinketh: and this will commonly (if it be marked) fall out to be true, that he that ſo vrgeth a charitable iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching ſuch things, and ſuch men as offend theſe and the like wayes, will be moſt vncharitable in his iudgement touching the beſt men, and the beſt things. As therefore we are not too ſharply to cenſure the falls of our brethren leſt we offend againſt the rule of charitie, ſo let vs take heede leſt vpon a fooliſh conceit of charity, we think well of that which indeed is euill, and ſoothe them vp in their ſinnes whoſe ſins were to be reproued. As the Preacher ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.18.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Be not thou iuſt ouermuch.</hi> And againe, <hi>Be not thou wicked ouermuch:</hi> ſo I ſay, let vs not too ſharply cenſure the faults of our brethren: and againe, let vs not too lightly paſſe ouer groſſe and notorious faults: let vs keep the rule of charity in iudging our brethren: and againe, let vs not (to ſeeme charitable) thinke of groſſe faults as ſmall or no faults: let vs not condemne, where the Lord hath not condemned: and againe, let vs not acquite, where the Lord hath not acquited.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here are to be reproued and condemned, ſuch as (to excuſe the faults and offences of others) ſay and do more then in a good conſcience they may. For, as I am not alwaies to condemne thoſe men that do ſuch things, as wicked and vngodly men, nor yet to acquit all thoſe that do ſuch things as good and godly men; ſo neither am I to excuſe one ſort
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:599:520"/> or other, further then in a good conſcience I may. Charitie muſt rule me to excuſe as I may, affection may not ouer-rule me to excuſe more then I ſhould. Albeit therefore to excuſe the faults of men may ſeeme a very charitable fault, yet if in any reſpect we do therein more then in a good conſcience we may, our fault is inexcuſable, and our iudgement ſleepeth not. Let vs therefore go ſo far in the excuſe of our brethrens faults as in a good conſcience we may, but no further. Let vs be ready to make the beſt of things we may, but let vs euer remember to hold faith and a good conſcience. And let this ſuffice to be noted from the ſeuerall points in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſpeake not, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle hauing ſignified in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe, his great reioycing in the Lord, for the <hi>Philippians</hi> care ouer him, now ſignifieth his reioycing to be, not ſo much for the preſent gift they ſent him, becauſe therewith his want was ſupplied, as for their ſakes, euen for the fruite which ſhould redound thence vnto them, which he doth from the eleuenth to the eighteenth verſe. Firſt therefore (to meete with the ſuſpicion of a couetous or an abiect mind,) he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he reioyced ſo greatly for the gift, becauſe by it his want was ſupplied: and yeeldeth a reaſon thereof, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had learned to be content with whatſoeuer ſtate; which contentment of minde he profeſſeth he hath of Chriſt, verſ. 11.12.13. Secondly, he telleth them, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he reioyce not in their gift, yet he commendeth their liberality ſhewed both now and at other times towards him, verſ. 14.15.16. Thirdly, he telleth them, that the thing wherein he reioyceth, is the fruite of their gift, for that it ſhall further their reckoning, verſe 17. Theſe be generally the points.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſpeake not, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words, as I ſaid, the Apoſtle to meete with the ſuſpicion of a couetous, or at leaſt an abiect minde, denyeth that he reioyced for their gift, as if before he had receiued it he had bin caſt downe through want, or were not able to endure his want. For thus it might be obiected and ſaid: Yea indeede, doth this care for you ſo greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce you? Like enough your heart was downe before this helpe came vnto you. No, no, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I ſpeake not
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:599:520"/> this becauſe of want,</hi> becauſe my want is ſupplied, as if before this ſupply came, I had bene caſt downe through want, or were not able to endure want. <hi>For I haue learned in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſtate I am, &amp;c.</hi> which is a proofe that it was not for the gift that he reioyced, becauſe his want was ſupplied by it, but for ſome other thing.</p>
                  <p>Where I note, that the Apoſtle was neither deiected and caſt downe through want, nor his affection much altered by the ſupply of his wants. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I obſerue who they are whom want doth not pinch to caſt them downe through heauines, namely, the children of God, who walke ſo as they haue the Apoſtle for an example. What? are not the children of God pinched with want? Was not <hi>Abraham</hi> driuen by famine out out of <hi>Canaan</hi> into <hi>Egypt?</hi> Was not <hi>Iſaac</hi> driuen by famine from one place vnto another? And was not the ſame lot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al the Patriarchs? Had our bleſſed Sauiour himſelfe a houſe to put his head in? Were not the holy Apoſtles tried, as by many other wayes, ſo by want? Yes ſurely, amongſt other afflictions, want and penurie is one, wherewith they that liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus are ſometimes preſſed and pinched. But this is it, though they be in want, yet they are not ouercome of want: euen as the Apoſtle ſaith, We are in pouertie,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8.</note> but not ouercome of pouertie. They looke vnto the Lord, and they reſt in him; they know that pouertie and riches, euen both theſe are from the Lord, who maketh poore and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth rich, and that all things worke together for the beſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that loue and feare the Lord. And therefore they hang not downe their heads, nor are caſten downe through heauines, they murmure not at the Lord, nor breake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to impatience, but patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly depend vpon that God that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the rauens to feede his Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> and that fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the yong rauens that crie for want of food. They know that the Lord careth for them though the world ſeeth it not, and that he will ſupply their wants, ſo farre as he ſeeth it good for them, and therefore they comfort and cheare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in him.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach vs, not to looke at mens wants, but how men are affected through their wants. Pouertie or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="874" facs="tcp:599:521"/> are no certaine arguments of the loue or of the hatred of God towards any. Both are mercies and bleſſings of the Lord vnto the godly, and both are plagues and ſnares vnto the wicked. By pouertie and want the godly are oftentimes tryed, to ſee whether they will blaſpheme God to his face; whether they will murmure againſt the Lord, whether they can be content, as to receiue good at the hand of God, ſo to receiue euill; whether in time of aduerſitie they will go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Lord. By riches likewiſe the godly are often tryed, to ſee whether they will thereby grow proud, and forget the Lord; whether they will, as good Stewards, vſe them to the glorie of his Name, and the good of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; whether they will beare themſelues as enriched by him, and make him their chiefeſt treaſure. Both theſe (I ſay) are trialls vnto the godly, that the triall of their faith may be found to their praiſe, and honour, and glorie at the appearing of Chriſt Ieſus. Againe, pouertie is often laied vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for a plague, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſheweth, where he telleth the Sluggard,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 6.11.</note> that his <hi>pouertie cometh as one that trauelleth by the way, and his neceſſitie as an armed man:</hi> and riches are often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them as ſnares, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, where he ſaith, that <hi>they that will be rich,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.</note> 
                     <hi>fall into tentation and ſnares, and into many fooliſh and noyſome luſts which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction.</hi> Pouertie then or riches, plenty or want, are not the things that we are to looke vnto, for that theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the wicked with the godly; but how they worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon mens affections, what effects they haue among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men. Doth thy pouertie and want make thee hang downe thy head, breake thy heart through heauineſſe, cauſe thee to murmure and grudge againſt thy God, driue thee to thinke of vnlawfull ſhifts for the ſupply of thy wants? &amp;c. then I ſtand in feare of thee, neyther can I comfort thee with any ſweete promiſe of grace and mercie. But art thou chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in thy God notwithſtanding thy penury and want, doſt thou waite vpon him, depend vpon him, and endure pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently? Is it enough for thee that he can ſupply thy wants if he will, and therefore then doeſt meekly ſubmit thy ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his will? Then ſurely thou art rich in Gods fauour, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:599:521"/> thee belongeth an inheritance among the Saints. Againe, do riches lift thee vp in pride aboue thy brethren, ſet thee a running after noyſome luſts and pleaſures, choake the word, and the graces of Gods Spirit within thee, and make thee to ſtart aſide from thy God like a broken bowe? then thy riches are a ſnare vnto thee, and they turne vnto thy deſtruction: but if thou vſe them to Gods glory, the good of thy brethren, and thine owne onely honeſt and godly comfort, then they are a bleſſing vnto thee, and a token of Gods fauour. As then the Wiſe man ſaith, There is that gathereth, and yet ſcattereth; ſo I ſay, There is that wanteth, and yet is rich, that is rich, and yet wanteth; that wanteth the worlds ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and yet is rich in Gods fauour, and that is rich in worldly wealth, but poore in Gods ſight. As we beare or drowpe vnder our pouertie, ſo we are poore or rich in the Lord: and againe, as we vſe or abuſe our riches, ſo we are poore or rich vnto God. If then we be in want, let vs not be caſt downe with heauineſſe. but let vs be chearefull in our God, who can ſupply what wanteth if he will, and will if he ſee it good. If we haue plenty, let vs not abuſe it to riotouſneſſe and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, but let vs vſe it to Gods glorie; ſo ſhall our want be comfortable, and our riches a bleſſing vnto vs.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow in theſe next verſes following, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſignifieth his reioycing to be, not ſo much for the preſent gift it ſelfe which they ſent him, as for the fruit which thence ſhould redound vnto them: and in theſe words, <hi>I ſpeake not, &amp;c.</hi> he denieth that he reioyced
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:599:522"/> becauſe his want was ſupplyed by their gift, as if before that ſupply came vnto him, he had bene caſt downe through hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe, or were not able to endure his want. Where, in that he was not caſt downe through want, I obſerued who they are whom want doth not pinch to caſt them downe through heauineſſe; namely, the children of God who walke ſo as they haue the Apoſtle for an example. Not that the children of God are neuer pinched with want, but though they be oft-times in want, yet are they neuer ouercome of want. For they looke vnto the Lord, and reſt in him; they know that he maketh poore and maketh rich, that he can ſupplie their wants if he will, and that he will, if he ſee it good: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they drowpe not, they murmure not, but they depend vpon him, they comfort themſelues in him. Which ſhould teach vs not to looke to mens wants or riches, but how theſe worke on their affections, what effects follow theſe in them. For pouerty and riches, plenty and want, euen both theſe are common to the wicked with the godly, but they do not alike affect them both. The wicked, through want, drowpe, and murmure, &amp; fall to all vnlawfull ſhifts, to ſupply their wants: but the godly are cheerefull in their God, waiting vpon him, depending vpon him, enduring patiently; holding it enough that God can if he will, and will, if he ſee it good, ſupply their wants. Againe, through riches the wicked grow proude, runne after their luſts and pleaſures, oppreſſe their brethren, and forget their God; but the godly vſe their riches to the glorie of God, the good of their brethren, and their owne honeſt and lawfull vſe and comfort. As therefore we beare or drowpe vnder our wants, we are poore or rich in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: and againe, as we vſe or abuſe our riches, we are poore or rich in Gods fauor: and therfore, this is the thing that we are to looke at, how men are affected through their pouerty or their riches. Thus farre we haue already proceeded. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For I haue learned, &amp;c.</hi> This is the reaſon whereby the Apoſtle proueth that he ſpake not becauſe of want, that the ſupply of his want by their helpe, was not the cauſe of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, as if before that ſupply came, he had bene caſt down
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:599:522"/> through heauineſſe; but now that they had holpen him he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced. And his reaſon ſtandeth thus: I haue learned to be content with my owne eſtate whatſoeuer it be, therefore it is not the ſupply of my want by your gift that cauſeth my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, but another thing. <hi>I haue learned.</hi> How had he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? He had learned out of the word, that he ought to be content with his eſtate whatſouer it was. But he had learned by long experience to be content with his owne eſtate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it were: if he were in labours, in perils, in watchings, in hunger and thirſt in faſtings, in cold and nakednes, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had taught him to be content with theſe things. Which he farther proueth, by an enumeration of diuers ſtates, wherein he knew how to carry himſelfe, and therewith to be content. <hi>I can be abaſed,</hi> that is, if being in pouertie and want, I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and debaſed, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer excellent graces of the Spirit I haue, I know how to carry it, I can be content, and not droupe the head: <hi>and I can abound,</hi> that is, if I abound in honour, wealth or fauour, I know how to carry it, I can be content, and not be proud. <hi>Euery where,</hi> for time and place, and <hi>in all things</hi> belonging to this life, <hi>I am inſtructed</hi> and religiouſly taught (for ſo the word ſignifieth) <hi>both to be full and to be hungrie, and to abound and to haue want,</hi> and ſtill I can be content with which of theſe eſtates ſoeuer, and neither grow inſolent through my better, nor be caſt downe with heauineſſe through my meaner eſtate, nor relinquiſh my dutie in my calling whatſoeuer be my ſtate. This I take to be the meaning of theſe words. So that here we haue a reaſon of his deniall in the words immediatly before, and a confirmation of the reaſon, by an enumeration of diuers ſtates wherein he knew how to carry himſelfe, and therewith to be content. Now let vs ſee what inſtructions we may gather hence for our further vſe and benefite.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which I note is from the reaſon of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in that he ſaith, he hath learned, in whatſoeuer ſtate he is, therewith to be content. Whence I obſerue a leſſon very fit for vs, and for all Chriſtians to learne, euen to be content with our eſtate whatſoeuer it is. The Apoſtle had learned this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by his owne long experience: we haue precept, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:599:523"/> and experience to teach vs this leſſon.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6.7.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle) <hi>is great gaine, if a man be content with that he hath. For we brought nothing into the world, and it is certaine that we can carrie nothing out. Therefore when we haue food and raiment, let vs therewith be content.</hi> Where firſt to the commendation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, he ſhewes it to be the fruite of godlineſſe. For as godlineſſe hath this honour to be the onely great gaine of Chriſtians; ſo hath it this fruite, that the man that is godly, is content with that he hath. Secondly is ſet downe the reaſon which might and ſhould make vs to be content with that we haue: <hi>For we brought nothing into the world, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly is ſet downe an exhortation vnto contentment, which may and ought to be vnto vs a precept, that when we haue food &amp; raiment, we ſhould therewith be content. To the like purpoſe is that part of our bleſſed Sauiours Sermon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</note> where in earneſt maner, and by many arguments he diſſwadeth vs from care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for food and raiment. For what elſe in effect is all that but a precept to be content with that we haue, and to depend vpon the Lord his prouidence for the reſt? But if we had no precept or exhortation at all, the very example of our Apoſtle might and ſhould preuaile with vs. For ſo he had taught vs in the former Chapter,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Brethren, be followers of me, and looke on them which walke ſo, as ye haue vs for an example.</hi> He then being content with his eſtate whatſoeuer it was, we ſhould looke on him, and likewiſe be content with our eſtate whatſoeuer it be. Whereunto might alſo the examples of our bleſſed Sauiour, and of all that haue liued godly in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, be added. For all the godly were alwayes content with whatſoeuer ſtate they had; and if they were not content, they were not godly; diſcontentment being as great an enemie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to godlineſſe as any. But what needeth more to this purpoſe then the experience of Gods children euen at this day? For this, ſo many as feare the Lord, learne by continuall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at this day, that be our feete pinched in the ſtockes with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> or ſuffer we famine with the holy Patriarks, or be we perſecuted by cruell tyrants with <hi>Eliah,</hi> or be we ſpoiled of all that euer we haue by theeues, or by fire with <hi>Iob;</hi> or be we deſtitute of wealth, friends, and very neceſſaries for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:599:523"/> of this life; or tempted, afflicted and tormented with the faithfull children of God in the Primitiue Church; yet ſtill the Lord careth for vs, and by his will all theſe things happen vnto vs; and as he ſeeth it good, he deliuereth vs out of all our troubles. <hi>I haue bene yong,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.25.</note> 
                     <hi>and now am old, yet neuer ſaw I the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging their bread.</hi> In which place the Prophet bringeth in his owne experience to ſhew that the righteous are not forſaken at any time of the Lord, though ſometimes they may ſeeme to be forſaken; neither do their poſteritie beg their bread, as dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to any exigent further then the Lord ſeeth it to be for their good and his owne glory. And vpon the like experience which the children of God find in themſelues, and ſee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at this day, they may ſay the like. For though ſometimes they be afflicted on euery ſide, yet are they neuer in diſtreſſe, but haue a good iſſue; though ſometimes they be in pouertie, yet are they neuer ouercome of pouertie; though ſometimes they be perſecuted, yet are they neuer forſaken; though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they be caſt down,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8.</note> yet they neuer periſh, as ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of himſelf. Why ſhould not then euen experience teach vs this leſſon, to be content with our eſtate whatſoeuer it is?</p>
                  <p>But it may be it wil be queſtioned what it is to be content? The word which the Apoſtle here vſeth, properly ſignifieth ſuch a one as is ſo content with that he hath, as that he reſteth wholly in himſelfe, neither needeth any thing of any other. And ſo onely God himſelf is properly ſaid to be content with that he hath, becauſe he alone is al-ſufficient hauing all things in himſelfe, and needing nothing from any other, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely bleſſed and onely perfect. But here in this place, he is ſaid to be content with that he hath, whoſe preſent eſtate wherein God hath ſet him, whatſoeuer it is, doth ſo ſatisfie him, that albeit he need many things, be much preſſed, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and afflicted, yet he is contented, and patiently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeth whatſoeuer the Lord his will is. Whereas then by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and example, and experience, ye ſee, we are taught to be content with our eſtate whatſoeuer it is, the meaning is, that the preſent eſtate wherein God hath ſet vs, whatſoeuer it is, and whoſoeuer we be, ought ſo to ſuffice and ſatisfie vs, that
<pb n="880" facs="tcp:599:524"/> though in it we want many things, yet with it we ſhould be content. The reaſon is: firſt becauſe it is the ſtate, be it poore or rich, wherein the Lord hath ſet vs; and therefore not to be content with it, were to reſiſt his will, and to become fighters againſt the Almightie. Secondly, becauſe howſoeuer we may ſeeme to want things that are needfull for vs, yet are we not forſaken of the Lord; and indeed howſoeuer the world ſeeth it not, nor cannot, yet do we want no maner of thing that is good For that of the Prophet is alwayes true,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lions lacke and ſuffer hunger, but they which ſeeke the Lord, ſhall want nothing that is good;</hi> good for them, and good for his glorie. Want we may many temporall bleſſings, and yet we want nothing that is good, becauſe the Lord knoweth it to be good that we want them. Wanting then nothing that is good, what reaſon but we ſhould be content?</p>
                  <p>Should we then be content with our preſent eſtate, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is? This then ſhould teach vs to take heed and beware of couetouſnes, that monſter of ſinnes, which makes vs change our God, worſhip other gods, and fall downe before a wedge of gold, being therefore called idolatrie. The couetous man he is neuer content with that he hath, but the more he hath, the more ſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he craueth: his deſire is like vnto hell, it is neuer filled, but with the horſe leech ſtill he crieth, Giue, giue; and like vnto the graue, or the barren wombe, or the earth that ſtil drinketh in water, or the fire which the more fuell it hath, the more it is nouriſhed; he neuer ſaith. It is enough. If he haue but a litle, he thinketh he hath not enough; if afterwards he haue more, yet he thinketh he hath not enough; if after that he haue more, yet he thinkes of another enough, and enough is alwaies to come, though alreadie he haue more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Yea if with <hi>Ahab</hi> he haue a kingdome, yet ſhall not poore <hi>Naboth</hi> be able to hold his owne by him, but his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, euen his onely vineyard he muſt haue, and he will haue. Many ſuch there are which haue enlarged their deſires like hell, which can neuer be content with that they haue, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they haue. Whereupon are murmurings, contentions, mutinies, warres, thefts, and all vniuſt dealing, and in a word all euill.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10.</note> For <hi>couetouſnes</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>is the roote of all
<pb n="881" facs="tcp:599:524"/> euill, which while men luſt after, they erre from the faith, and pierce themſelues through by many ſorrowes.</hi> We may not therefore be like vnto theſe, but, hating couetouſnes, we muſt be content with that portion which the Lord hath giuen vs, be it more or leſſe; with that ſtate wherein he hath ſet vs, be it better or worſe. It he ſee it good to lift vp our heads when we are low, he will; and again, if he bring vs downe from on high, he doth it becauſe he ſeeth it good. Howſoeuer therfore it be with vs, let vs be content.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.32.</note> 
                     <hi>Your heauenly Father</hi> (ſaith our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiour) <hi>knoweth that ye haue need of theſe things:</hi> and againe, <hi>If ye which are euill can giue good gifts vnto your children,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">7.11.</note> 
                     <hi>how much more ſhall your Father which is in heauen giue good gifts to them that aske him?</hi> Doth our heauenly Father know what we haue need of? and wil he giue vs the things which we need? If then we need health, he will ſend it if it be good for vs: if we need wealth, he will ſend it if it be good for vs: if we need liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he will ſend it if it be good for vs: if we need peace or loue in the world, he will giue it if it be good for vs; and generally whatſoeuer we need, we ſhall haue if he ſee it to be good for vs. Let vs not therefore with the couetous worldling, neuer thinke we haue enough; nor with the mal-contented perſon, alwayes miſlike our preſent ſtate whatſoeuer it is. He that openeth his hand, and filleth all things liuing with plenteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, hath enough for vs always in ſtore, libertie enough, health enough, wealth enough, &amp;c. to reach out vnto vs if he ſee it good for vs. Let our eyes therefore alwayes waite vpon him, and let vs learne in whatſoeuer ſtate we are, therewith to be content.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note, is from the confirmation of the Apoſtles reaſon, where he ſaith, <hi>I can be abaſed, &amp;c.</hi> For in that he ſaith, <hi>I can be abaſed, and I can abound, be full and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, &amp;c.</hi> he ſpeaketh as well vpon experience in himſelfe as he had found that he could doe, as vpon a religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he ſhould do ſo. So that he had as well felt hunger and want, and bin abaſed, as bene full and abounded. Whence I obſerue, that the Lord in beſtowing his temporall bleſſings vpon his children, doth not alwayes keepe the ſame courſe, but ſome he bleſſeth with plentie and abundance, others he
<pb n="882" facs="tcp:599:525"/> exerciſeth with penury and want, and vnto others he giueth experience of both.<note place="margin">

Thus the Lord miniſtreth his temporall bleſſings as he will, to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, and to the ſame men at ſome times more, and at ſome times leſſe; euen to all and at all times according to the good pleaſure of his will. In ſome of his children he will be glorified by their pouertie and want, by their croſſes and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:599:525"/> by their loſſes and diſgraces: for in that in theſe things he giueth them a patient and contented, and chearefull mind, ſo that they are not ouercome of theſe things, nor caſt downe through heauineſſe as the wicked, herein God is glorified. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in ſome of his children he will be glorified by their wealth and riches, by their honour and preferments, by their power and authoritie: for, in that in theſe things he ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth them, that they vſe them to the glorie of his name and the good of their brethren, and not ſwell thereby, nor abuſe them as the wicked do, herein he is glorified. Againe, in ſome of his children he will be glorified both in plentie &amp; in want, both in honour and in diſhonour: for in that by theſe things he ſo ballanceth them, that they runne on an euen courſe, and neither ſink too low by the one, nor are lifted too high by the other, herein alſo is he glorified.</p>
                  <p>Let this then firſt teach them that abound in wealth and greatneſſe, theſe two points: firſt, not to diſdaine their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in wealth and greatneſſe, as too meane for them to haue any dealing at all withal. For how meane ſoeuer they be in the worlds account, and how deſtitute of all things ſoeuer they ſeeme to be, yet may they be as great in Gods fauour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound as much in the graces of Gods Spirit, as thou that haſt all things that thine heart can deſire. And yet what a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ordinarily it is for the inferiour to be admitted to the ſpeech of his ſuperiour? Well, admitting you both to be alike great in Gods fauour, the difference which I find betwixt you is this, that if thou be the greater and wealthier, thou haſt the greater account to make, which may not be any cauſe vnto thee to diſdaine thy brother. The ſecond point is, that they vſe their wealth and greatneſſe to the glory of God and the good of their brethren. For not the hauing, but the well vſing of our riches and authoritie, &amp;c. commendeth vs vnto God; and how much ſoeuer we haue, if we vſe it not well that which we haue, it is no token to vs of his grace and fauour towards vs. Nay, if he giue vs riches and honour, &amp;c. and not withall the grace to vſe them as we ſhould, they are vnto vs an occaſion of falling, of falling from God, of falling into idolatrie, of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into many fooliſh and noiſome luſts, of falling into all the
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:599:526"/> ſnares of the diuell. Haſt thou then wealth, honor, authoritie, &amp;c? They are the bleſſings of God beſtowed vpon thee, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou art. But wilt thou know whether they be ſpeciall fauours beſtowed vpon thee, as vpon his deare child? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then how thou vſeſt them: for ſo they are, and are not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauours vpon thee. Whereon if we did ſo thinke as we ſhould, we would not ſo delight and ſet our hearts on them as we do, but we would think of wel vſing them a great deale more then we do. As many therfore as God hath bleſſed with theſe things, let them ſtudie to glorifie the Lord by them, that ſo they may haue comfort in them, as in tokens of his ſpeciall fauour towards them: and alwayes remember to reioyce in the Lord, as in your chiefeſt treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for ſuch as are abaſed and in want, let this firſt be a comfort vnto them. For this, that they are abaſed and in want, that they are hungrie, thirſtie, cold, naked, reuiled, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, &amp; the like, is no token that God hath forſaken them, or ſhut vp his louing kindneſſe in diſpleaſure towards them. Nay, this is the cup that many of the beſt of Gods Saints haue deeply drunke on before them. Let them then comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in this, that thus they are brought into the fellowſhip of the Saints of God. Be it then tribulation, or anguiſh, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, or famine, or nakednes, or perill, or ſword, or all theſe that preſſe vs, let them not be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, but in all theſe things let vs be more then conquerours through him that hath loued vs. Whatſoeuer we ſuffer or want in the world, let vs comfort our ſelues in this, that it is the beaten way wherein many of Gods Saints haue walked vnto heauen. Secondly, let this teach them to bridle their tongues in their talke of them that are g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat and wealthy. It is a common fault with them of the meaner ſort to ſay of them, that they haue their riches in this world, they haue their honour here on earth. But we are to know, that the Lord hath them that belong vnto him in both ſorts of men, high and low, rich and poore. Neither therefore let plentie be a preiudice to them that abound; neither let want ſeeme to priuiledge them that lacke: but as euery man beareth his want, and vſeth his abundance, ſo let him be
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:599:526"/> thought to haue his portion among the righteous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuch as haue experience both of plenty, and of want, let them hence learne, not to ſtoupe at the one, or ſtumble at the other. Let not their wants diſmay them, nor their abundance exalt them. The Lord giueth, and the Lord taketh away; and his name is ſtill to be bleſſed. Whether therefore we are abaſed or abound, whether we be full or hungrie; whether we abound or haue want, euerie where, and in all things we are to bleſſe him, knowing that all things are according to his will.</p>
                  <p>Now giue me leaue in one word to point at one other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation from theſe words. In that he ſaith, <hi>I can be abaſed,</hi> and likewiſe, <hi>I can abound &amp;c.</hi> I obſerue a notable patterne of great perfection in a Chriſtian; for then we grow to a notable perfection, when we can both be abaſed and abound, be full and hungry, &amp;c. and ſtill be content with the one or the other without murmuring or grudging. The philoſophers and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then writers haue talked much of bearing both aduerſity and proſperitie patiently, and haue ſet downe good precepts for walking conſtantly in them both, without drouping in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, or ſwelling in proſperitie. But let any man tell me of the beſt of them, that kept that conſtant courſe in both, not danted with the one, nor puft vp with the other. Nay in this degree of perfection, none of them can, but our Apoſtle muſt be the patterne for vs to follow after, that we may all of vs ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I can be abaſed, and I can abound, &amp;c.</hi> Yea this is a thing which we ſhould all of vs know by experience in our ſelues, that we can be abaſed, &amp;c. and wherein we ſhould be inſtructed and taught as in a myſterie of religion, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, and to abound, &amp;c. for this is an holy point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knowledge to know to be abaſed, and to abound, to be content with either, and not to relinquiſh any Chriſtian duty for either.</p>
                  <p>But alas, how ignorant are all ſorts of men herein? In the Clergie, what ambitious ſeeking after the chiefeſt dignities? What heaping of liuings one vpon another, benefice vpon benefice, prebend vpon prebend, &amp; of benefices in Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam vpon Biſhopricks? In the Temporalty, what ioyning of
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:599:527"/> houſe to houſe, and laying of field to field? What prying and prowling into all kinds of commodities? What thirſting and gaping ſtill after more, more? And what is the cauſe of all? We haue not learned both to be full and to be hungrie, both to abound, and to haue want. It may be, we can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, but we cannot be abaſed: it may be, we can be full, but we cannot be hungrie: it may be, we can away with plenty, but not with want. This prickes and pinches, and is as bitter vnto vs as death: but haue we learned to abound and to be full? Nay we know not when we abound, or when we are full: and beſides that, abundance and fulneſſe makes vs wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and proude, and forgetfull of ſuch Chriſtian duties as we ought to performe, as might eaſily haue bene proued, if time had giuen leaue.</p>
                  <p>Long we then in our ſoules to grow forward in a good degree of Chriſtian perfection? Let vs learne both to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and to abound, &amp;c. Let not abundance or plenty make vs wanton, or proude, or forgetfull of our Chriſtian duties: neither let penury and want make vs murmure, or faint, or caſt vs downe through heauineſſe. Let vs walke conſtantly in both, in both let vs be content, and in both walke in thoſe holy waies which God hath ordained vs to walke in. If we can once take out this leſſon, it will bring with it ſuch a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfection, that we ſhall not be to ſeeke almoſt in any point of Chriſtianitie. Let vs therefore apply it, and as we grow either in wealth, or in want, let vs thinke on it, that daily more and more we may know to be abaſed, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and that daily more and more we may be inſtructed, euerie where, and in all things, both to be full, and to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, to abound, and to haue want.</p>

                     <hi>Am able to do all things, &amp;c.</hi> We haue heard what things the Apoſtle aſſumed to himſelfe, and they were great things; as that he had learned to be content with his eſtate whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it were, that he knew both to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and to abound; that euery where, and in all things, he was inſtructed both to be full, and to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, both to abound and to haue want. Now leſt he ſhould ſeeme to boaſt too much of himſelfe, or to giue others occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of boaſting themſelues, he giueth the whole glorie of all that he is able to do, in all the things that he ſpeaketh of, vnto Chriſt, that enableth him thereunto. For the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of which words, firſt it will be needfull to cleare them from that ſence whereunto ſome wreſt them. For tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the malice of Satan, no doubt, either blinding the eyes of our Aduerſaries that they ſhould not ſee the truth, or harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their hearts that they ſhould peruert the waies of truth: theſe words which by our Apoſtle are added (leſt he ſhould ſeeme to boaſt too much of himſelfe) are wreſted by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries vnto the greateſt boaſt of mans perfection that can be: theſe words wherein our Apoſtle giueth all glorie vnto Chriſt, are drawne by our Aduerſaries vnto the glory of man, and his perfect obedience. For, to proue that man in this life is able perfectly to fulfill the Law of God, they alledge this place as making to that purpoſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>I am able.</hi> So that they giue this meaning of theſe words; I am able, not onely to be abaſed, and to abound, &amp;c. but generally, I am able to do all things, euen all things that the Law requireth,
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:599:528"/> through the helpe of Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me, is, if he helpe and ſtrengthen me by his grace, that what abilitie I want in my ſelfe, may be ſupplied by him. And hereupon they conclude, that man regenerate is able, by the grace of Chriſt working together with him and ſtrengthening him, perfectly to fulfill the whole Law of God. Whereby, how much they peruert the meaning of the Apoſtle in this place, we ſhall eaſily perceiue, if we looke but a little into the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which hence they deliuer. For who is he that is able to loue the Lord his God with all his heart, with all his ſoule, with all his minde, and his neighbour as himſelfe? And yet this the Law requireth,<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we propheſie in part.</hi> Now, as is our knowledge, ſo is our faith, our loue, our obedience. For ſo long as we are clothed with the earthly houſe of this tabernacle, as our knowledge is vnperfect, ſo our faith, our loue, and our obedience are vnperfect. Yea, in the very beſt of vs there is alwayes a rebellion betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit; and the better we are, the ſharper oftentimes will the combate be. Who is he then that is able in this life perfectly to fulfill the Law of God? Vnto Chriſt Ieſus God gaue the Spirit without meaſure, and he was able perfectly to fulfill the whole Law of God, and did fulfill it for vs, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in vs, and we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. But vnto vs, I meane euen vnto the moſt regenerate and ſanctified man, the Spirit is giuen onely by meaſure, ſo that the fleſh and the luſts thereof are not altogether mortified and vtterly tamed
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:599:528"/> thereby, but oftentimes prickes they haue in the fleſh, and meſſengers of Sathan to buffet them. How farre off then are the beſt from perfectly fulfilling the whole law of God? Some indeed are ſaid in the Scriptures to haue walked in all the commandements and ordinances of the Lord without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, as <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and others to haue ſought the Lord with their whole heart, as thoſe godly Kings, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Aſa, Ioſiah, &amp;c.</hi> But we muſt vnderſtand, that as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and others are ſaid, not to haue followed the Lord with their whole heart, becauſe they made &amp; worſhipped other gods, ſo thoſe godly kings are ſaid to haue ſought the Lord with their whole heart, becauſe they haue the honor which was due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, to him alone: and that <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were onelie (in compariſon of others) ſaid to haue walked holily, &amp; vnblamably before men.

                     <hi>which drinketh ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie like water?</hi> In a word, not any of the ſonnes of men that euer were ſince the fall of man, or are, were or are able to fulfill the law of God, but onely vnperfectly, and not in any ſort perfectly, otherwiſe then by imputation. Chriſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience being imputed vnto them through faith, and that which is vnperfect in their obedience, being couered, and not imputed vnto them through Chriſt. So that ye ſee the doctrine which they deliuer from theſe words, is quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt throughout the whole Scripture. And therefore that cannot be the meaning of theſe words which they do giue.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if the Rhemiſts had thought theſe words to haue made any whit to that purpoſe, it is very like they would not haue failed to haue giuen that note hence. For we ſee how ready they are to wreſt all places to the maintenance of their erronious opinions. So that they paſſing this place ouer with
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:599:529"/> ſilence, it is very like that they otherwiſe thought of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe words, then others of their profeſſion haue done and do. Whether then we looke vnto the doctrine which they gather from theſe words, quite repugnant vnto the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the holy Ghoſt throughout the whole Scripture, or vnto the iudgement of ſome of themſelues, as it may ſeeme; it appeareth that the Apoſtles meaning is not, as our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do imagine, that he was able of himſelfe to do al things, not onely the things ſpoken of before, but all things gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally which the Law of God required, through the helpe of Chriſt which ſtrengthened him, and gaue further ſtrength and vertue vnto his owne ſtrength and vertue.</p>
                  <p>What then is the Apoſtles meaning in theſe words? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this (as appeareth by the tenour of them:) To cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of boaſting himſelfe touching the things that he had ſpoke of, he renounceth all his owne power and ſtrength, as if by his owne power and ſtrength he had bene able to do thoſe things, and he attributeth all vnto the power and ſtrength of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>I am able to do all things,</hi> euen all the things that I haue ſpoken of, that is, <hi>I can be abaſed, and I can abound, &amp;c.</hi> For ſo this vniuerſall ſpeech is to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the ſubiect and matter here ſpoken of, as vſually it is in other places of the Scripture: or if we will needes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it further, then thus, <hi>I am able to do all things,</hi> that is, all things that belong vnto my duty and calling. But how? by my owne power or ſtrength? No, but <hi>through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth</hi> and enableth <hi>me.</hi> He doth not ſay, through the helpe of Chriſt, as it is in our Engliſh Bibles: albeit that alſo might be ſaid, for that he is often ſaid to helpe vs in the things wherein he alone worketh altogether without vs: but he ſaith, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt,</hi> whoſe worke wholly and onely it is to ſtrengthen me by his holy Spirit in my inner man (for ſo the word ſeemeth here to ſignifie) to do theſe things, euen to ſuffer aduerſitie, and not be caſt downe through heauineſſe; and likewiſe to enioy proſperitie, and not be puffed vp with pride. This I take to be the ſimple mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle here. Where I note theſe two points, firſt, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that he is able to do all thoſe things;
<pb n="891" facs="tcp:599:529"/> ſecondly, by whom it is that he is able to do all things, euen by Chriſt which &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt point, where the Apoſtle ſaith, that he is able, &amp;c. it is to be noted that he ſaith, <hi>I am able.</hi> He doth not ſay, I was able, &amp;c. for indeede before he was called to the knowledge of God in Chriſt Ieſus, he was not able to do ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he ſaith, <hi>I am able,</hi> implying, that now that Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him by his holy Spirit, now that he is engrafted into Chriſt his bodie by the waſhing of the new birth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the holy Ghoſt, he is able to do all theſe things, to be abaſed, &amp;c. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regenerate by the Spirit of God, and engraffed into the true oliue tree Chriſt Ieſus, we are able to be full and to be hungrie, to abound and to haue want, and to do the things that are good. Before ſuch time as we be borne againe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of the Spirit, and be made partakers of the roote and fatneſſe of the true oliue tree Chriſt Ieſus, the very imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the thoughts of our hearts are onely euill continually; our throates are open ſepulchers, our tongues are full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, the poiſon of Aſpes is vnder our lippes, our mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſſe our feete are ſwift to ſhed bloud, deſtruction and calamitie are in our wayes, the way of peace we know not, the feare of God is not before our eyes: and in one word, we are wholly auerſe from euerie thing that is good, and onely inclined vnto that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; being not grapes but thornes, not figs but thiſtles, not good but ill trees, not liuely but dead branches, not friends but enemies, not the ſons of God, but the children of wrath; not citizens, but aliants from the common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the couenants of Promiſe. But being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the Spirit, our hard hearts are ſoftned, our froward wills are reformed, our darke mindes are inlightned, our inordinate affections are ordered, our wicked thoughts are bettered, and our whole man ſo made partaker of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature, that we flie the corruption which is in the world through luſt, and ſtudy to liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world. So that henceforth we are able to flie that which is euill, and to do that which is good: which
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:599:530"/> alſo thoſe manifold exhortations in holy Scripture imply, when we are exhorted to follow the truth in loue, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our earthly members, to procure things honeſt before God and all men &amp;c. For albeit vnto the wicked and vnregenerate the Lord hath not opened their eyes or their cares that they can ſee the things that belong vnto their peace, or hearken vnto inſtruction, and receiue vnderſtanding: yet hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed thus to ſtirre vp his children, and made them able to do the things whereunto they are exhorted.</p>
                  <p>We do not then (as our aduerſaries falſly charge vs) in the queſtion of Free-will, make men ſtockes and ſtones, ſuch as in the things that are good, do nothing at all. Ye ſee, we ſay, that being regenerate by the Spirit of God, we are able to be abaſed, and to abound, &amp;c. to do the things that belong vnto our peace, and ſuch as accompany our ſaluation. As therefore the Apoſtle ſaith vnto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.</note> 
                     <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that be loſt:</hi> ſo I ſay, If any man be not able to do the thing that is good, it is the man vnregenerate, in whom Chriſt dwelleth not by the power of his Spirit. Here then is the point, not whether we be able to do the things that are good, for that we hold; but whether we be able by our owne power and ſtrength at all to do the things that are good, by whom it is that we are able to do theſe things, which was the ſecond point that I noted in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond point then, ye ſee the Apoſtle ſaith, he was able to do all things; but how? Through Chriſt which ſtrengthened him. He was able, but the power and ſtrength whereby he was able, was whence? in any part from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? No, no ſuch word; but from Chriſt, who dwelt in him by his Spirit, and ſtrengthened him ſo, that he could be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, and he could abound, and ſtill be content with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Whence I obſerue, that the power and ſtrength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are able to do whatſoeuer thing is good, is not from our ſelues, but from Chriſt, who by his holy Spirit ſo ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth vs in our inner man, that we can be content with proſperitie or aduerſitie, and are enabled to do the things that are good. And to this the holy Ghoſt giueth witneſſe in very many places;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:599:530"/> thing as of our ſelues, but our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> Where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth not denie that we are able to thinke that is good; but he ſaith, that we are not able of our ſelues as of our ſelues, but onely by God. So in this Epiſtle, <hi>It is God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which worketh in you both the will and the deed, euen of his good pleaſure.</hi> Where he denieth not that we are able to will or to do the thing that is good, but he ſaith that it is God that worketh in vs both the will and the deed, of his good pleaſure. Not to trouble you with mo places to this purpoſe, by theſe ye ſee that it is not of our ſelues but of God, that we think, will or do the things that are good. We think the things that are good, but it is he that makes vs thinke the things that are good, by ſuggeſting good cogitations into vs by his holy Spirit which dwelleth in vs. We will and deſire the things that are good, but it is he that makes vs will and deſire the things that are good, by working good motions and holy deſires in vs by his holy Spirit which he hath giuen vs. We flie the things that are euill, and do the things that are good; but it is he that makes vs flie that which is euill, and do that is good, by miniſtring ſtrength vnto vs through the power of the Spirit in vs. We know how to be abaſed, and how to abound, how to be full, and how to be hungrie, &amp;c. but it is God that enableth vs hereunto by the ſtrength of his holy Spirit which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs. Without him we can do nothing, as himſelf telleth vs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5.</note> not thinke any part of a good thought, not will any part of a good deſire, not do any part of a good deed; ſo wholly is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good gift from him: but by him we are able to do all things that our dutie requireth of vs, though not in that degree of perfection which we ought, by reaſon of the ſinne which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſo faſt on vs, yet ſo as he will be well pleaſed with vs, and perfect his praiſe in our weakneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Here then firſt falleth to the ground that errour of theirs who maintain that we are able to do the things that are good by our owne power and ſtrength, being onely holpen by the grace of Chriſt. What is man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould deſire to part ſtakes with his Maker? Doth not <hi>God worke all in all?</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith ſo: and ſhall not he then haue the glorie of all? Haſt thou any good thing that thou haſt not receiued of the Lord? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="894" facs="tcp:599:531"/> thinketh not: why then reioyceſt thou in it, as though thou hadſt not receiued it? In Chriſt we haue all good things that we haue, whether for this life preſent, or that that is to come; and whatſoeuer good things we do, we are wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled thereunto through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth vs. Let not vs therefore ſet foote into any part of his glorie, but as it is written, <hi>Let him that reioyceth, reioyce in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this teach vs what we are in our ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt; not fit for any thing that is good, not able to do a good deed, not able to will any thing that is good, not able to thinke a good thought, content with no eſtate, in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie caſt downe with heauineſſe, in proſperitie puft vp with pride, in want comfortleſſe, in abundance retchleſſe, &amp; much worſe then thus. And yet how ready are we to ſooth vp our ſelues, and how gladly do we heare the praiſes of others for any thing that we ſay or do well? Nay rather then faile, we will breake out into our owne praiſes; and worſe then that, we will either ſhut him out of all, vnto whom all praiſe is due, or elſe enter vpon a part with him. So farre in loue are we with our ſelues, that we forget Chriſt, though without Chriſt there be nothing to be loued in vs. But let vs learne to know what we are in our ſelues, and let vs be confounded in our ſelues; and for whatſoeuer we ſay or do well, let him haue the praiſe, vnto whom all praiſe is due.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this ſhould teach vs in all things to glorifie the name of Chriſt Ieſus, and to depend vpon him. Are we perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and yet faint not, in pouertie and not ouercome of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, tempted and yet ſtand faſt, any way troubled and yet not diſmayed? It is by Chriſt Ieſus. Flie we any thing that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? do we any thing that is good? It is by Chriſt Ieſus. He knoweth what we haue need of, and he giueth it: he knoweth that without him we can do nothing, and therefore be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth vs in all things. Sometimes his owne arme helpeth vs, and ſometimes he ſtrengtheneth vs ſometimes to do, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſuffer thoſe things which otherwiſe we could not. How ought our mouthes then to be filled with his praiſes, and how ought we alwaies to depend vpon him? By him we ſtand, and without him we fall. Let our ſongs therefore alwayes be
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:599:531"/> of him, and let his praiſes be euer in our mouthes for ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cies as we haue of him, and let vs pray alwayes with all maner prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit for the ſtrength of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Notwithſtanding, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle according to that wiſedome that was giuen vnto him, moſt wiſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> for their liberalitie ſent vnto him. For the Apoſtle hauing before moſt peremptorily ſignified his conſtancie both in aduerſitie and proſperitie, that through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth him he could be content whether he were abaſed or did abound; the <hi>Philippians</hi> might haply ſay, Then our liberalitie needed not, you could haue bene as well without it as with it, and therefore we might very wel haue ſpared both our labour and our liberalitie. No, no, ſaith the Apoſtle notwithſtanding that through Chriſt which ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth me, I can be content whether I be full or hungrie, yet ye haue well done that ye haue communicated to mine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ye haue well done, becauſe ye haue done your dutie, ye haue done that which Chriſt commandeth, ye haue done that which hath great recompence of reward. But how did they communicate vnto his affliction? We muſt vnderſtand, that we may communicate vnto the affliction of Gods Saints three wayes: firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 16.28.</note> when we ſuffer the like afflictions that they do for Chriſt his ſake, whether it be at the ſame time, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did; or at diuers times, as now the Saints of God which ſuffer, and are perſecuted for righteouſnes ſake, as were the Prophets and Apoſtles before. Secondly, when we are afflicted and mourne in our ſelues for the affliction of Gods Saints, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we do not ſuffer in our bodies with them. Thirdly, when we miniſter vnto them what comfort we can in words, and what helpe we can in deeds. And thus the <hi>Philippians</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated vnto <hi>Pauls</hi> afflictions lying now in priſon, ſending vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him their miniſter, and with him ſuch gifts as might ſupply his wants. And this is it for which the Apoſtle in theſe words commendeth them. I can onely point at ſuch things as were hence to be obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Firſt in that the Apoſtle ſaith, Notwithſtanding that I am able to endure want through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me,
<pb n="896" facs="tcp:599:532"/> yet ye haue well done, &amp;c. hence I obſerue, that the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and patience, and contentment of Gods Saints, ought not to be any ſtay vnto vs of performing Chriſtian dutie which we owe vnto them. And yet how willingly do we make eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſerue to vs for an excuſe of ſlacking ſuch duties as we ought to performe to Gods Saints? If they be in priſon, or if they be in any pouertie and want, and beare it patiently and chearfully, we commend them; but neither by word we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, nor by other our helpe we relieue them. And why? They are chearful enough, they need not our comfort: though they want, yet they are content with that they haue, they beg not, and therefore we may ſpare our purſe well enough. But our Apoſtle tels vs, that notwithſtanding it be thus with them, yet we ſhall do well to comfort them and to helpe them. Yea and ſurely it is the beſt done, that is done vnto them. For they by ſuch their contentednes and chearfulnes, giue good teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie that they belong vnto the couenant, that they are of the houſhold of faith: and we as we are to <hi>do good vnto all,</hi> ſo <hi>especially vnto them which are of the houſhold of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, they did well to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to his affliction, I obſerue, that it is a good deed to comfort and to helpe the Saints of God in their affliction and trouble.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15.</note> And that it is ſo, appeareth both for that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as a dutie, practiſed of the godly, and hath with it great recompence of reward. <hi>Weepe with them that weepe,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle. What is that? That is, let their afflictions moue you to compaſſion; and in token of your compaſſion, comfort and helpe them in their affliction. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> openeth it more largely,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Remember them that are in bonds, as if ye were bound with them, and them that are in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as if ye were alſo afflicted in the bodie.</hi> Thus did the Apoſtle himſelfe, as himſelfe witneſſeth, where he ſaith, <hi>Who is weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burne not?</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid, Beſides mine owne afflictions which befall my ſelfe in mine own perſon, there is no other afflicted, but they touch me alſo with a compaſſion with them, both to ſorrow with them, and to helpe them as I can. And ſee the recompence of reward that followeth it, <hi>Come</hi> (ſhall Chriſt ſay) <hi>ye bleſſed
<pb n="897" facs="tcp:599:532"/> of my Father, inherite ye the kingdome prepared for you from the foundatione of the world; for I was an hungred and ye gaue me meate, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the Lord in mercie, and for his promiſe ſake, rewardeth them that comfort and helpe his poore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Saints in their affliction whatſoeuer it is. So that we cannot doubt but that it is well done to communicate to the affliction of Gods Saints by helping and comforting them.</p>
                  <p>It is then not well done not to communicate to their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And yet who remembreth the affliction of <hi>Ioſeph?</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good lawes and Acts we haue for the prouiſion of the poore; I wiſh due execution of them. Beloued do we beleeue the communion of Saints? It is an article of our beliefe, and we will be loth to be tainted in any of them. As then we are ioyned in a fellowſhip with all Gods Saints, ſo ſhould we be touched with a feeling of ſuch of their miſeries as are in any kind of affliction. They are bought with as deare a price as we are, they are members of the ſame body with vs. And ſhall the head in the naturall body ſtoupe downe vnto the foote if it be prickt or hurt, to looke vnto it and to helpe it, and ſhall not we looke vnto our poore brethren and diſtreſſed, &amp; helpe them? Surely if it be well done to communicate to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, then it is not well done not to communicate to their afflictions; and if eternall glory in the heauens be the recompence of their reward that communicate to the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Saints, then what ſhall be their reward that do not? The King, euen our bleſſed Sauiour ſhall ſay vnto them in that day, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41.</note> 
                     <hi>which is prepared for the Diuell and his Angels. For I was an hungred &amp;c.</hi> While we haue therefore time let vs do good vnto all men, but ſpecially vnto them which are of the houſhold of faith. Let vs not forget the miſerie of the poore in their trouble. Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poore and needie, the Lord ſhall deliuer him in the needfull time of trouble.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd ye Philippians, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle hauing in the former verſe commended the <hi>Philippians</hi> for their liberalitie ſent vnto him lying now in priſon at Rome, as very well done ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to communicate vnto his afflictions; in theſe two next verſes goeth forward with the like commendation of their liberality euen ſince his firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell vnto them. Firſt, by comparing them with the reſt of the Churches of Macedonia, verſe 15. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by giuing them this teſtimonie, that euen when he was abſent from them, and labouring with other Churches, they miniſtred vnto his neceſſitie, not once, but once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And leſt by this his great commendation of their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie he might ſeeme to looke after a new benefit, verſe 17. he telleth them, that as his reioycing in the Lord, whereof he ſpake before, was not for his owne ſake, or for the ſupplie of his want by their liberalitie; ſo neither this his commendation of their liberalitie from the firſt vnto the laſt, was for his owne ſake, or that he deſired a new gift of them, but both the one, and the other was for their ſakes, and that in both he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the fruite which might further their reckoning. This I take to be the generall purpoſe of the Apoſtle in theſe words. Now come we vnto a litle more particular examination of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ye:</hi> By this that he ſaith, <hi>ye alſo, &amp;c.</hi> he meaneth that not onely he, and the other Churches of Macedonia, but they alſo knew this that he now ſpeaketh; what? namely, that in
<pb n="899" facs="tcp:599:533"/> the beginning of the Goſpell, that is, at my firſt coming into Macedonia, and preaching the Goſpell vnto you: for he ſpeaketh not ſimply of the beginning of the Goſpell, but of the beginning of the Goſpell in that countrie of Macedonia, whereof Philippi was the chiefe citie,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 16.12.</note> and the firſt place that we reade he preached in, in that countrey. This then, ſaith he, ye know, that at my firſt coming and preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vnto you, when I departed from Macedonia, that I might preach in other countries alſo, no Church of all the other Churches of Macedonia, neither Theſſalonica, nor Amphipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, nor Apollonia, nor any of the reſt, communicated with me concerning the matter of giuing and receiuing, but ye only. Where firſt in that he ſaith, when he departed, &amp;c. hence ſome gather that his manner was, where firſt he preached the Goſpell to take nothing of them till his departure from them, and then to take of them ſufficient for his iourney to the next place, and for his prouiſion there till he ſhould depart from them. Secondly, in that he ſaith, no Church communicated with him concerning the matter of giuing, &amp;c. his meaning is, that whereas he had beſtowed on the other Churches ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, he had not, as had bene meete, receiued of them againe temporall things. The phraſe of ſpeech here vſed is borrowed from merchants or others which haue their books wherein they ſet downe their layings out, and their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings in, that when they make their counts there may be a proportion in thoſe things. So he meaneth that betweene thoſe other Churches of Macedonia and him there ſhould haue bene this proportion, that as he had miniſtred vnto them ſpirituall things, ſo they ſhould haue miniſtred vnto him of their temporall things. Thirdly, in that he ſaith, but ye onely, he commendeth them aboue the reſt of the Churches of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia. In the next verſe when he ſaith, <hi>For when I was in Theſſalonica,</hi> he addeth this farther to the commendation of the <hi>Philippians</hi> for their liberalitie, that beſides their liberality at his departure from them, when he was in Theſſalonica, the metrapolitan city of Macedonia, and they had heard that he hauing paſſed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, and being now in Theſſalonica, none communicated vnto him; they
<pb n="900" facs="tcp:599:534"/> ſent vnto him once and againe while he was there to ſupply his neceſſitie. In the verſe following, when he ſaith, <hi>not that I deſire, &amp;c.</hi> his meaning is as he ſaid, verſe 11. that he ſpeaketh not this, he commendeth them not thus, becauſe he now, or at any other time deſired a gift of them ſo much for his owne ſake, and for the ſupply of his owne wants; but to ſignifie the very true cauſe of his reioycing, verſe 10. and the very true cauſe of this his commendation of them, he ſaith, <hi>but I deſire the fruite, </hi> whereby he ſignifieth that the principall thing which he regarded in their gifts and liberalitie, was the fruite which ſhould follow thereupon to further their reckoning, for that the Lord in that day ſhould reckon this to their van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and accept it for good payment. The phraſe of ſpeech here vſed, is likewiſe borrowed from the merchants counting booke; for as in caſe of the debt of a great ſumme of money vnto a merchant, the more money that is noted in his booke as payed, the more his reckoning is furthered that payed it; ſo the Apoſtle ſignifieth that the moe of their charitable works towards him were as it were noted in Gods booke, the more their reckoning was furthered with God, who recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that to their fruite which they did vnto him. So that the cauſe of his reioycing, and commending their liberality prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally was, becauſe of the fruite which thence redounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them from God, who would recompence it in the heauens into their boſomes, and accept it in mercie as ſome acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of their debt. This I take to be the true meaning of theſe words. And now that we vnderſtand the meaning of the Apoſtle in theſe words, let vs ſee what profitable notes we may gather hence for our farther vſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ye Philippians.</hi> In that the Apoſtle ſaith, that when he departed from Macedonia, none of the other Churches of Macedonia, but the <hi>Philippians</hi> onely, communicated to his neceſſitie, hence it may ſeeme might be obſerued an example of great ingratitude in thoſe Churches, that withheld their temporall things from the Apoſtle, when he had miniſtred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them ſpirituall things. But I dare not altogether ſo iudge them, becauſe of that notable teſtimonie which our Apoſtle giueth vnto them in the latter to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Where he
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:599:534"/> propoſeth their example vnto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.2.3.4.</note> thereby to ſtirre them vp to the reliefe of the poore Saints, and teſtifieth, that in their moſt extreme pouerty they were richly liberall; that beyond their power they were willing, and that they euen preſſed the Apoſtle to receiue their reliefe towards the poore Saints. A rare example of great piety, and very tender compaſſion. So that I impute their not communicating vnto the Apoſtles neceſſity, at this time, rather vnto forgetfulnes, and ſome want of care for this time (which was ſometime the fault of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> as we heard before) then vnto vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, or any ſuch notorious fault. The Apoſtles purpoſe I take rather to be to commend the <hi>Philippians,</hi> then deepely to cenſure the other churches.</p>
                  <p>In this then that he ſaith, that when he departed from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, no church &amp;c. I note the thing for which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> aboue the other churches of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia; which was, the performance of that Chriſtian dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, to miniſter vnto him temporall things when he had beſtowed on them ſpirituall things. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that where ſpirituall things are beſtowed vpon vs, there we ſhould miniſter temporall things; where the Miniſter teacheth vs with the word, there we ſhould make allowance of maintenance vnto him. Which point the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proueth at large in the former to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and by many arguments: as firſt, by an argument taken from Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>goeth a warfare any time at his owne coſt?</hi> How much more ſhould they that fight the Lord his battels, fight them at the churches coſt? Secondly, by an argument taken from planters of Vines. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof?</hi> How much more ſhould they that plant and worke in the Lord his vineyard eate of the fruits of their owne labours: Thirdly, by an argument taken from them that are occupied about cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell? <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flocke?</hi> How much more ſhould they that feede the Lord his flocke with the ſincere milke of the word, be fed by them with temporall food: Fourthly, by an argument taken from the teſtimonie of <hi>Moſes,</hi> where he ſaith,<note place="margin">9.</note>

                  <p>Which may ſerue to admoniſh many of vs of a neceſſarie duty wherein we vſe great ſlacknes. Some of vs can be very well content neither to be taught in the word, not to giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maintenance to the Preachers of the word. And theſe are men altogether ſenſleſſe, without all feeling of God or god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, in whoſe hearts the day-ſtarre of righteouſnes hath not yet riſen, that they ſhould know or thirſt after the things that belong vnto their peace. Others of vs could be better con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent a great deale to giue ſomething to ſtay the Miniſtery of the word, that ſo we might continue in our ignorance, and ſleepe in our ſinnes, then to haue the word preached vnto vs. And theſe are men, not ſicke, but dead in ſinne, deſperately wicked, and vnto euery good worke, reprobate. Others of vs can be content to hearken to them that labour in the word
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:599:535"/> and doctrine, and that they ſhould preach often, but care not how little to heare of allowance toward their maintenance. If they ſpeake of the Miniſters duty, of the aſſiduitie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which they ought to vſe, of the neceſſitie that lieth vpon them to preach the Goſpel, of the woe that is vnto them if they do not preach the Goſpel, we like them well, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them much. But if they ſpeake of their owne mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, of their allowance due on our parts vnto them: what ſay we then? Then forſooth they tell their owne tales, they preach for themſelues.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 10.8.</note> Nay we can diſpute very wel againſt them out of the Scriptures in this point, and tell them that freely they haue receiued, and freely they muſt giue,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.8.</note> and that <hi>Paul</hi> laboured with his owne hands, becauſe he would not be chargeable to them whom he taught. But ſee how herein we deceiue our ſelues. He that ſaith, <hi>Freely ye haue receiued, freely giue,</hi> doth he not immediately after ſay, that <hi>the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is worthie of his meate?</hi> What then, doth our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour croſſe himſelfe? God forbid. And yet either we muſt ſay ſo, or elſe that the former words make nothing againſt the maintenance of Miniſters, eſpecially the latter words being both ſo plaine in themſelues, and likewiſe alledged by the Apoſtle for the Miniſters maintenance.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim</hi> 5.18.</note> For the meaning then of thoſe words; firſt I ſay, that they are to be vnderſtood of working miracles; which gift, as the Lord freely beſtowed on his Apoſtles and Diſciples for a time, for the better gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of men vnto the faith, ſo he would haue them freely ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed forth vpon men, that as <hi>Elizeus</hi> the Prophet could by no meanes be wrought to receiue any thing of <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian for healing his leprouſie, ſo whatſoeuer ſickeneſſe they ſhould heale, whatſoeuer miracles they ſhould worke, they ſhould not be wrought to take any thing for it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any man ſhall contend that the words are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Lords worke generally, that as freely they haue receiued the grace, ſo freely they do the worke, then I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the words by that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> that they are to <hi>feede the flocke of God which dependeth on them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.</note> 
                     <hi>caring for it not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthie lucre, but of a readie, minde.</hi> Surely it is no way the meaning of thoſe words, that
<pb n="904" facs="tcp:599:536"/> they that labour in that holy worke, ſhould be debarred of wages for their labour. Neither doth the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (labouring with his owne hands) at all make againſt the maintenance of the Miniſterie by the Church. Firſt, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he wrought with his hands, not for that he ought ſo to do (for he proueth that they ought to haue miniſtred vnto him) but that they might haue no exception againſt him. Secondly, the example of the Apoſtle herein is no way to preſſe vs, for that he needed not, as we, to attend vnto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but being immediately taught of God, and furniſhed with all knowledge in the third heauen, he was able at all times to teach the way of God perfectly, though he wrought with labour and trauell night and day. But we cannot intend manuarie matters, and do the duties of our calling. Our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to attend vnto reading to exhortation,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13.</note> and to doctrine; and the Church is to miniſter vnto vs neceſſary maintenance. How cunningly therefore ſoeuer we thinke we can diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the maintenance of the Miniſter by the Church, yet do we but deceiue our ſelues therein. This is true generally, that whatſoeuer we ſay or diſpute, we will giue as little to his maintenance as may be, we will withhold from him as much as we can, we thinke that wel gotten that is ſaued from them, and we thinke euerie little too much that they haue.</p>
                  <p>Beloued, I haue no cauſe but to perſwade my ſelfe better things of many of you. Onely I ſpeake how it fareth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with men abroad. The peoples readineſſe in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to deceiue their Miniſters in all kinde of their tithes, is often ſpoken of vnto vs that haue ſome farther experience therein then what we haue by heare-ſay. As for vs, let it not be ſo with vs, but let vs be ready to communicate vnto him that hath taught vs in the word, that there be no complaint of our not communicating concerning the matter of giuing and receiuing. Euery labourer is worthie of his wages. Let vs not deny them vnto him that oftentimes ſteepes his labors with vs in his owne bloud. Nay, let vs giue them cheerefully vnto him as vnto him that watcheth for our ſoules. It is but copper that we giue for the pureſt gold. Let vs not ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this exchange, but let vs offer it moſt willingly.</p>
                  <pb n="905" facs="tcp:599:536"/>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note in theſe words is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> onely communicated with him concerning &amp;c. They waited not to ſee what the other Churches would do, whether they would giue the Apoſtle ought or no, or what they would giue, or when they would giue, but they bethought themſelues what they were in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do, and that they did, though they onely did it. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that looke what is our dutie to do, that we are to do, though none ioyne with vs. If <hi>Noah</hi> ſhould haue looked what the old world did, and haue faſhioned himſelfe like vnto them, he had bene like to haue periſhed in the waters with them. But he looked what his God required of him, and though none ioyned with him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6.7.</note> yet he alone walked with the Lord, and therefore he alone was ſaued, when the reſt of the old world was drowned with the waters. Or if <hi>Lot</hi> ſhould haue looked to the wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and defiled himſelfe with their vnlawfull deedes, he had bene like to haue bene conſumed in the fearfull burning of thoſe ſinfull cities.<note place="margin">19.</note> But he looked to the Law of his God, &amp; though none ioyned with him, yet he alone walked in the wayes of the Lord, and therefore when the citie, and they that were in it were deſtroyed, he was ſaued. Or if that Samaritane that was cleanſed with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nine, ſhould haue ſtaied to waite what the other nine would do, his leproſie might haue taken hold of him againe. But he conſidered his owne duty, and <hi>when he was healed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 17.</note> 
                     <hi>he turned backe, and with a lowd voice praiſed God, and fell downe at his feete on his face, and gaue him thankes:</hi> and therefore he was praiſed of the Lord, and cleanſed of his leproſie. All which examples ſhew plainly vnto vs, that we are not to looke what others do, but what we are to do; and though all the reſt of the world bow the knee vnto <hi>Baal,</hi> yet muſt we with <hi>Eliah</hi> looke vnto the Lord our God, and ſerue him alone: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is our dutie to do, that muſt we do though we onely do it. Though there be but few that ſtriue to enter in at the ſtrait gate, yet muſt we ſtriue to enter in at the ſtrait gate:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 13.14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2.</note> neither may we follow a multitude to do euill. It is our duty that we muſt looke vnto, and be there many or few, any or
<pb n="906" facs="tcp:599:537"/> none beſides our ſelues to ioyne with vs, yet muſt we do that which our duty requireth of vs.</p>
                  <p>This may teach vs to reforme a great fault in our ſelues. We are none of vs growne to that height of impiety (I hope) that in a deſperate moode we will ſay, that we had rather go to hell with company, then go to heauen alone. But this is a great fault with many of vs. In matters of contribution vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any good purpoſe, what do we ſay? No reaſon we ſhould contribute alone, we wil ſee what others will do; if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, we will; if they will not, we will not; and ſaying thus, we thinke we ſay well; and if we adde this, let others do, and in proportion we will not be behinde the beſt, then we thinke no man can ſay more, or better. But thus ſtill we depend vpon the doing of others, whereas in doing good we ſhould one go before another, and rather ſtriue to be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vnto others, then ſtand vpon the example of others. If we be the foremoſt, it may be others will follow vs; and if we be alone, it is better to walke in the way alone, then out of the way with others. In matters likewiſe of election what do we ſay? We would gladly beſtow our voyce on the beſt, but the moſt go another way, and we can do no good by ſingling our ſelues from the reſt, a note of ſingularity we may bring vpon our ſelues; if there were any poſſibility to do good, we would beſtow our voice as we ſhould, but being none, we may not loſe our voice that way, but beſtow it another way. Thus we looke at the example of others, and offend by the example of others, whereas rather by our example others ſhould be condemned which do not as we do. Beloued, let this be our rule, to looke what we ſhould do, not what others do. Let vs do that we ought, though we alone do it, &amp; let vs flie the reſt, how many ſoeuer follow it. Let vs by our exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple prouoke others to do that is good, and if they do not follow it, let their iudgement be vpon their owne head. If we alone walke in the waies of our duty, our reward is with our God, but their iudgement ſleepeth not, that either will not walke with vs, or forſake vs in the way.</p>
                  <p>In the next verſe the Apoſtle giueth this teſtimonie vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that when he was abſent from them, when
<pb n="907" facs="tcp:599:537"/> he was in Theſſalonica, they ſent their liberalitie once and againe vnto him to relieue his neceſſitie. Wherein firſt I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a notable patterne of that great care which ought to be in the people for their Miniſter. The people ſhould after the example of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> be carefull to inquire into the ſtate of their Miniſter, and as they ſhall vnderſtand him to neede this or that help, this or that encouragement, ſo they ſhould be willing once and againe, euen as neede is with all cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, wherein ſoeuer they may to helpe them. But farre otherwiſe is the practiſe with vs. If his liuing be ſmall, and he ſuch a one as laboureth painfully in the word amongſt vs, yet will we not relieue him; and if we ſend once and againe vnto him, it ſhall be when we haue got ſome aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſome that may vexe and trouble him, and either weary him of all, or turne him out of that little that he hath. His bareneſſe and his want ſhall be his reproach amongſt vs, but no cauſe of any holy care for him. It ſhould not be thus, but as the <hi>Philippians</hi> did, ſo ſhould we do, euen take all care for them that teach vs in the word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the perſon of <hi>Paul,</hi> I note that it was <hi>Paules</hi> neceſſitie which the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſent once &amp; againe to relieue. Whence I obſerue, that euen the beſt Miniſters of the Goſpel of Chriſt Ieſus are ſometimes vrged and preſſed with neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. In <hi>Paul</hi> indeed it was leſſe maruell, both becauſe that was the infancie of the church, and for that he alwaies went about either planting or ſtabliſhing the Churches, and ſetled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in no certaine place. But now that the Church is ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and the Miniſterie ſettled, that now ſometimes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beſt ſhould be preſſed with neceſſitie, I know not well what to ſay to it. It is certainely one of the ſhames and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credites of our Clergie, that in many places the worthieſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers want, and the verieſt loyterers abound. Some lights of the church haue either nothing, or as litle as litle may be: &amp; againe, ſome others, that either cannot, or will not do any good in the Church at all, haue liuing vpon liuing, &amp; dignitie vpon dignitie heaped vpon them. Ye ſee the note which I ſhould proſecute: but time will not giue me leaue.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot that I deſire a gift &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle ſignifieth the very true cauſe of that his ioy in the Lord, whereof he ſpake before verſe 10. and the very true cauſe of this his commendation of their liberality in the two verſes next before. For, as before he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in verſe 11. that the principall cauſe of his reioycing was not becauſe of his want, becauſe his want was ſupplied by their liberalitie; ſo now he ſignifieth that the principall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their liberalitie was not for that he deſired a new gift of them, as ſome thereby might haply imagine; but the principall thing which he regarded both in the one, and in the other, the principall cauſe both of his reioycing in the Lord for their care for him, and of his commendation of their liberalitie both firſt and laſt towards him, was the fruite which followed thereupon to further their reckoning in that day of the great account. <hi>But I deſire &amp;c.</hi> The phraſe of ſpeech here vſed is borrowed from the Merchants counting-bookes: for as in caſe of the debt of a great ſumme of money to a Merchant, the more mony that is noted in his booke as payed, the more his reckoning is furthered that payed it; ſo the Apoſtle hereby ſignifieth, that the more of their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table workes towards him, were noted, as it were, in Gods booke, the more their reckoning was furthered with God, who in the great account ſhould reckon that to their fruite &amp; aduantage, which they had done to him. What was then the things which the Apoſtle principally deſired, euen more then their gifts though he needed them? It was the fruite of their liberalitie, that they might reape the fruite thereof with
<pb n="909" facs="tcp:599:538"/> God. And what was the fruite of their liberality? Namely, the furthering of their reckoning with God in that day when they ſhould giue accounts of that they had done in their fleſh, whether it were good or euill; for the Apoſtle knew that this fruite ſhould follow their liberalitie towards him, that thereby their reckoning ſhould be furthered with God, who would reckon that vpon their head to their vantage that they had done to him. And this was it which principally cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Apoſtle to ioy in their gifts and liberality. Thus much for the opening of the meaning of theſe words. Now let vs ſee what obſeruations we may gather hence, whereof to make ſome farther vſe for our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not that I deſire a gift.</hi> The firſt thing which here I note is the Apoſtles diligent care to cleare things as he goes. In verſe 10. of this Chapter the Apoſtle ſignified his great reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Lord for the <hi>Philippians</hi> great care for him, ſhewed by the things which they ſent him by their miniſter <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus.</hi> Whereupon leſt it ſhould be thought that before he receiued their gift, he had bene caſt downe through heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or were not able to endure his want, he cleares himſelfe of all ſuſpicion of any ſuch abiect mind, and tells them in the next verſe, that he ſpake not becauſe of want, that is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced not ſo much, becauſe his want was ſupplied by their liberality, but there was another matter in it. Againe, in ver. 11.12. he ſignified that he could be content with whatſoeuer ſtate he were in, that he knew how to be abaſed, and how to abound, that he was inſtructed both to be full, and to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, to abound and to haue want. Whereupon leſt he ſhould ſeeme to haue boaſted himſelfe too much of himſelfe, as if by his owne power and ſtrength he had bene able to do all thoſe things, he cleares himſelfe of all ſuch arrogant preſuming of his owne ſtrength, and tells them verſe 13. that he is able to do all thoſe things: but how? by his owne power and ſtrength? No, but through Chriſt which ſtrengthened him. Againe, the Apoſtle hauing ſaid that through Chriſt which ſtrengthened him he could endure want, and he could be content whether he were full or hungrie,  hereupon it might be thought that he made ſmall account of their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:599:539"/> and could as well haue bene without it as with it. He therefore cleares this point alſo, and tels them that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he could do all things through Chriſt, yet they had well done to communicate to his affliction. Againe in verſes 15.16. he highly commended the <hi>Philippians</hi> for their great liberality towards him euen from the firſt vnto the laſt, and preferreth them before all other Churches of Macedonia. Whereupon leſt he ſhould ſeeme to affect a new benefit, to deſire a new gift, he cleares himſelfe of any ſuch deſire, and tels them plainly that he doth not ſo commend them for that he deſireth a gift of them. Thus, ſometimes to cleare the truth of doctrine, ſometimes to free himſelfe from vniuſt ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, alwaies to rectifie them that they do not miſconceiue of things, euermore he cleares matters as he goes. Whence I obſerue a good leſſon for the Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt Ieſus, which is, that he giue all diligence in his teaching ſo to cleare things as he goes, as that his people may not miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any thing either touching the truth, or touching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. He is to be iealous of both, euen with a godly iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; of the truth, that no ſpeech of his may cauſe them to erre touching the truth; that he ſpeake not any thing againſt the truth, but for the truth; that in all ſimplicitie and plainneſſe he deliuer the truth; or if at any time he ſpeake ſomething which may be miſtaken, yet he ſo cleare it before he leaue it, as that there neede to be no doubt of it. Of himſelfe, that no ſpeech ſlip him, nor any action paſſe him whereby he may be noted of impatience, or pride, or contempt, or couetouſneſſe, or any ſuch ſpot of life; or if he do ſpeake, or do any thing whereby any ſuch ſuſpition is or may be faſtened on him, that he ſo cleare it, that he quite wipe it out; for if the truth be preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.7.</note> it is a ſtumbling blocke in a brothers way, and a woe is vnto him that putteth a ſtumbling blocke before his brother to cauſe him to fall: or if his own perſon be preiudiced, it is an hinderance vnto the worke of his Miniſterie, &amp; wherein ſhall he haue any comfort if not in the worke of his Miniſterie? If the example of our Apoſtle euen in this Chapter were not a ſufficient preſident for all Paſtors of Gods people to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I might adde thereunto both the example of our bleſſed
<pb n="911" facs="tcp:599:539"/> Sauiour, and likewiſe of the reſt of the Apoſtles: for who ſo looketh into the new Teſtament ſhall ſee them alwaies ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in this point, as they do not miſſe the teaching of any thing which might either preiudice the truth, or their owne perſons. But I paſſe ouer further proofe for this point.</p>
                  <p>This firſt might ſerue for a very good inſtruction vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Miniſterie in theſe our daies; for how many are there in many places, that ſometimes moue moe doubts then they do anſwer? How many that ſometimes ſo ſpeake, as that they leaue their hearers in greater ſuſpence then they found them? How many that ſo ſpeake, as that their hearers by that they ſpeake, cannot diſcerne whether they be Proteſtants or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts? How many that couch their matters ſo cloſely, and handle things ſo obſcurely, as if they would not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood? of whom ye ſhall heare ſome ſay when they come from them, they are fine men, great ſchollers, learned Diuines: but aske them what they learned? they can ſay iuſt nothing. How many are there that ſay they care not what, nor what men gather of that they ſay? How many that ſpeake ſmoothingly, how many that ſpeake egrely, and yet neuer labour to cleare themſelues of hatred, and of flatterie? Some are negligent &amp; careleſſe to conſider what they ſpeake, and theſe neuer thinke of clearing things as they go. Others are ſo little zealous of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, that though ſomething ſlip them which may hazard the truth, yet they will willingly let it go; and theſe care no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for clearing things as they go. Others loue to carrie things in the clouds, and ſo to ſpeake as that a man ſhall be little the better or the wiſer; and theſe will not cleare points as they go. But beloued, what ſhould I ſpeake to you of theſe things? Ye ſee what duty lyeth vpon vs by the example of the Apoſtle; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo to cleare things as we go, as that ye may not miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of what we ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>Hence then learne you to giue al diligence in hearkening to the things that we ſpeake: for if we be to be ſo carefull as that nothing ſlip vs which we cleare not, leſt ye ſhould miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of any thing, then ſurely are ye to be as carefull of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that we ſpeake, that ſo ye may conceiue aright of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is ſpoken. Otherwiſe if your thoughts be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:599:540"/> and your wits (as we ſay) a woll-gathering, what paines ſoeuer we take in clearing of things, yet do ye miſtake things. And hereupon it is that we ſuſtaine many wrongs of them that heare vs. We muſt take paines, and labour that ye may conceiue aright of all that we ſpeake; and ye muſt ſleepe a little and heare a little, and wander in your thoughts a little and heare a little; and then in ſomething miſtaking vs, ye muſt runne vpon vs, and we ſaid, ye know not what. Howſoeuer this be commonly a fault amongſt hearers, yet beloued, let it not be ſo amongſt you. When ye come hither, pray vnto the Lord that he will ſtirre vp your dull minds by his holy Spirit, that he wil vouchſafe to bleſſe the miniſtery of his holy word vnto you; and when ye are here, giue all diligence to hearken, that ſo ye may conceiue aright of the things that are ſpoken, that ſo by the things which ye heare the Lord may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and your ſelues edified, &amp; builded vp into a perfect man in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note is, the Apoſtles fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards the <hi>Philippians;</hi> for in that he ſaith, that he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth not a gift, but the fruite which may further, &amp;c.</hi> he ſheweth that as fathers in their tender affection towards their children deſire not any thing of them but for their behoofe and good; ſo he in his tender loue towards them, deſires not any gift of them, but for their behoofe and good in the day of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Whence I obſerue what a fatherly affection there ought to be in the Paſtor towards his people, namely ſuch, as that he ſeeke not theirs, but them; not his owne profit, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his people, that they may be ſaued. Thus our Apoſtle often profeſſeth that he did; as where he ſaith, that he <hi>ſought not his owne profit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14.</note> 
                     <hi>but the profit of many that they might be ſaued;</hi> and againe where he telleth the ſame <hi>Corinth.</hi> that he ſought not theirs, but them. Wherein he hath left a preſident for vs, that as he hath done ſo we ſhould do alſo. What then? Is not the Paſtor to labour with his people in the word and doctrine for their ſaluation, and to deſire nothing of them, to looke for nothing at their hands? No, not ſo; for we heard the laſt day, that where ſpirituall things are ſowne, there carnall things are to be reapt, and that he that teacheth may as well require
<pb n="913" facs="tcp:599:540"/> them of them that are taught in the word, as the ſouldier may do his pay, or the labourer his wages, or he that planteth a vineyard of the fruite of the vineyard, or he that feedeth a flocke of the milke of the flocke. But as at the firſt he is not to vndertake this ſacred and holy function in any couetous or ambitious deſire for worldly maintenance or promotion, but in an holy deſire to gaine men vnto the faith and knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus; ſo at no time is he ſo much to reſpect the gift and maintenance that he hath by his people, as the ſaluation of his people in the day of Chriſt Ieſus. In a place therefore where his liuing is allotted, and his maintenance ſet, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his liuing ſhould not ſo much reioyce him, as to ſee his people offer their duties willingly, and giue them cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for that this is a token of their growth in pietie, &amp; a fruite which ſhall ſurely further their reckoning. And ſo likewiſe in a place where onely a voluntary contribution is made for a time, the allowance whatſoeuer it is, is not ſo much to reioyce him, as the euident tokens of their pietie therein which make it, which ſhall further their reckoning. And the care which in both places is by him to be taken, is not to be for his owne profit, but for the profit of his people that they may be ſaued, euen for the gaining of them in the faith and knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus. To which purpoſe alſo is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Feede the flocke of God which dependeth on you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.</note> 
                     <hi>caring for it not by conſtraint but willingly, not for filthie lucre but of a readie mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as our Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Though ye haue ten thouſand inſtructers in Chriſt, yet haue ye not many fathers;</hi> ſo may it now be ſaid, though many Churches and many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations haue many Miniſters and teachers, yet haue they not many ſo fatherly affected as ſeeke not their owne profit, but their profit that they may be ſaued. If we ſhould looke into the Popiſh Clergie, it would eaſily appeare by their practiſe what it is they ſeeke and deſire. For to what end are their trentals, diriges, maſſes, buls, pardons, and ſuch other their traſh, but for that they deſire gifts, and ſeeke after their owne profit? It were to be wiſhed that they onely were ſuch, and that there were no ſuch amongſt vs. But what ſhall we ſay of
<pb n="914" facs="tcp:599:541"/> them that ſo they may get in, care not how they come in, in at the window, or downe at the houſe top? that ſticke not at theſe matters of ſimonie and corruption, but ſwallow them downe greedily? that take the fourth, fifth, ſeuenth, tenth, twentieth part of the liuing, and leaue the reſt vnto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron? that flie to Tarſus when they ſhould go to Niniueh, and rather reſide any where then where they ſhould? that heape li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vpon liuing, and dignitie vpon dignitie, and come ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at none, or but at ſome one of them? that feede them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and fleece their flocks, but do not labour with them in the word? that keepe no proportion concerning the matter of giuing and receiuing, but reape as many carnal things as they can, and ſow either none, or as few ſpirituall things as they can? Do not theſe ſeeke their owne profit more then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the people that they may be ſaued? Are not theſe of thoſe that ſeeke their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts? If they could ſay any thing for themſelues, it is all well, ſurely I cannot ſay any thing for them. I wiſh that they who by their place may and ought to looke to the reforming of theſe things, would in an holy care looke vnto them, and as much as in them is reforme them. Worke there will be; for hardly will theſe things be reformed.</p>
                  <p>Now as there are many in the Miniſterie that neither are, nor wil eaſily be perſwaded to be ſo fatherly affected towards their people as to ſeeke them, and not theirs, or more then theirs; ſo, beloued, are there many among you that heare vs, and vnto whom we are ſent, that will hardly be perſwaded of any of vs that we ſeeke not yours but you, that we ſeeke not our owne profit, but yours that you may be ſaued. Nay if we tell you that it is not your worldly commodities that we ſo much ſeeke after, that it is not your carnall things that we ſo much deſire, but that the principall thing that we long after euen from our very heart roote, is your godly growth in the faith and knowledge of Chriſt, and your ſaluation in the day of Chriſt, what do ye commonly twit vs withall? namely this, that we ſhall long tell you thus before you will beleeue vs. And this is one great cauſe in my iudgement why oftentimes we labour all night and catch nought, why we ſpend our
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:599:541"/> ſtrength in vaine, and for nothing amongſt you, euen your hard perſwaſion of vs as wanting all ſuch fatherly affection towards you. But as the fault is great of ſuch in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as want ſuch affection towards you, ſo is your fault alſo great to thinke that none in the Miniſterie are ſo affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. Where therefore their preſence, their diligence, their watchfulneſſe, their care ouer you giue you no other cauſe, there perſwade your ſelues the beſt of your Miniſters and Teachers. Yea perſwade your ſelues of this, that they ſeeke not yours but you, that they ſeeke not their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit but yours that ye may be ſaued, that they deſire not a gift, but the fruite which may further your reckoning.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which I note is that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the fruite of their liberality towards him ſhall redound to the furtherance of their reckoning in the day of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Whence I obſerue a notable commendation of charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe towards the poore, afflicted, and diſtreſſed, and generally of good workes. The commendation is this, that looke what we giue vnto the poore and afflicted members of Chriſt Ieſus, looke generally what good we do, that ſhall as it were be reckoned vpon our head in that day when we ſhall giue our accounts what we haue done in the fleſh, whether it be good or euill. For imagine that it were with God as it is with man, and that he had a booke wherein were noted as our debts ſo our payments; in the day when the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhall be made, whatſoeuer charitable worke we haue done vnto any of Gods Saints ſhall be reckoned vnto vs for good payment, and the moe we haue done, the more ſhall our reckoning be furthered; nay the good workes that here we haue done they ſhall then be recompenced with eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the heauens.<note place="margin">

<pb n="916" facs="tcp:599:542"/> ſuch recompence of reward is, becauſe Chriſt reckoneth it as done vnto himſelfe, whatſoeuer is done vnto his members here on earth. If they be perſecuted, he is perſecuted, as that his voyce from heauen ſhewed when he cryed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4.</note>

                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then? Is ſaluation in the heauens the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our workes? yea, it is ſo. Is it a reward due vnto our workes? Yea, it is ſo.

Euen for the promiſe ſake made vnto vs in Chriſt Ieſus. For therefore do we claime ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation as due vnto our workes, euen becauſe God hath made that promiſe in Chriſt Ieſus vnto our workes. But what was the cauſe of his promiſe? was it our workes ſeene, or foreſeene that they would be of ſuch deſert? No, but of his owne free grace and mercie towards vs, according to the good purpoſe of his will he promiſed it vnto vs. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>By grace are ye ſaued through faith, not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe.</hi> And againe, <hi>Not by the workes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which we haue done, but according to his mercie he ſaued vs.</hi> Thus we teach, and euery where we exhort all men vnto
<pb n="917" facs="tcp:599:542"/> good works, and holineſſe of life, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then here, beloued, learne you to skill what manner of men they be that charge vs that we preach onely faith, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention not, or elſe condemne good works. Ye ſee we tell you out of our Apoſtle here, that they ſhall further your reckoning in the day of Chriſt Ieſus. And therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to abound in euery good worke vntill the day of Chriſt Ieſus: and know them to be of their father the diuell that ſay, that either we mention not, or condemne good works vnto our people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence learne to acknowledge and to magnifie the great mercy of our God, who accepteth that for a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our reckoning, which if he ſhould deale with vs in iuſtice could ſtand for no payment; for how I pray you ſtands it? We ſhould bring gold for payment into the Lords trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie. But we bring lead, and he accepteth it for gold. Our beſt righteouſneſſe is full of vnrighteouſneſſe, yet doth he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. What? for our righteouſneſſe ſake? No, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake, and imputeth vnto vs the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus. Let our mouthes therefore alwaies be filled with his praiſes for ſuch his louing mercies towards vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let this be a ſufficient motiue vnto you to ſtirre you vp vnto charitableneſſe, and vnto euery good worke; for ſeeing ſuch is their acceptance with God that in that great account they ſhall further your reckoning, what ſhould ſtay you but that ye ſhould labour to be fulfilled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe? Time cuts me off that I cannot ſpeake of theſe things, and I ſhall the next time be farther occaſioned to ſpeake of them by occaſion of the text.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I haue receiued all.</hi> Hitherto we haue heard the Apoſtles thankfulneſſe vnto the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for their care for him, and his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them for their liberalitie towards him. Now he commendeth their liberality, and withall addeth a promiſe of recompence of reward for their liberality, and ſo concludeth the Epiſtle with praiſe and thankſgiuing vnto the Lord. In verſe 18, firſt he ſignifieth the faithfulneſſe of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Now I haue receiued all:</hi> all? what? to wit, all that you ſent by <hi>Epaphroditus.</hi> For herein he giueth him this teſtimony, that he had receiued the whole ſumme of him which came from them, which it is like they had ſpecified. Secondly, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth their liberality of the quantitie of it, when he ſaith, <hi>I haue plentie, and am filled.</hi> For hereby he ſignifieth that their liberality towards him was not ſcanted, but was ſuch as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſupplied his wants, ſuch as filled his deſires; not that the gift which they ſent him was ſo great and magnificent, (for the Churches of Macedonia were but poore,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2.</note>) but though it were but ſmall, yet ſuch was his contentment, as that he was as well ſatisfied and as fully as the greateſt man with his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt riches. Thirdly, he commendeth their liberalitie of the acceptableneſſe of it vnto God, when he ſaith, <hi>An odour that ſmelleth ſweete &amp;c.</hi> For herein by a ſpeech borrowed from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices made by fire for a ſweete ſauour vnto the Lord, he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that their liberality was as acceptable and pleaſant vnto God, as the ſacrifice that ſmelleth ſweete in the noſtrils of the Lord. Theſe are the principall points contained in theſe words, and this I take to be the meaning of them. Now
<pb n="919" facs="tcp:599:543"/> let vs ſee what notes we may gather hence for our further vſe and inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which here I note is the faithfulneſſe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paphroditus,</hi> who kept nothing backe of all that the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſent vnto the Apoſtle, but faithfully deliuered whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſent vnto him. Whence I obſerue a notable patterne of that faithfulneſſe which ought to be in al Chriſtians, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that truſt whatſoeuer it is that is repoſed in them: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſuch ſhould be their faithfulneſſe, as that they whom it doth concerne, may ſafely giue them this teſtimonie, that they haue diſcharged the truſt that was repoſed in them. Such was the faithfulneſſe of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who when he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the people of Iſrael, <hi>Whoſe Oxe haue I taken?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>or whoſe Aſſe haue I taken? or whom haue I done wrong to? or whom haue I hurt? or of whoſe hand haue I receiued any bribe to blinde mine eyes therewith? and I will reſtore it you.</hi> They ſaid vnto him: <hi>Thou haſt done vs no wrong, nor haſt hurt vs, neither haſt taken ought of any mans hand.</hi> So faithfully he had walked amongſt them in all things, that they gaue him teſtimonie of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe before the Lord, and before his Annoynted. Such faithfulneſſe alſo our bleſſed Sauiour figureth out vnto vs in the Parable of the ſeruants, vnto one of whom he gaue fiue talents, and vnto another two, to occupie withall vntill he ſhould returne whence he went, and in the end gaue them this teſtimonie, <hi>It is well done good ſeruants and faithfull,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.</note> 
                     <hi>ye haue bene faithfull in little, I will make you rulers ouer much, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your Maſters ioy.</hi> And the Apoſtle telleth vs general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>it is required of the diſpoſers, that euery man be found faithfull.</hi> Be it publique or priuate things, for the bodie, or for the ſoule, goods of the Church, or other goods that we are truſted withall to diſpence and diſpoſe, it is required of vs that we be faithfull, euen ſo faithfull, that if neede be, they whom it doth concerne, may ſafely giue vs their teſtimonie thereof.</p>
                  <p>A good leſſon for men of all ſorts to learne: for Prince and ſubiect, that for their faithfulneſſe each to other, each may receiue of other this teſtimonie, I haue receiued all loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, I haue receiued all right of ſoueraignty; For Paſtor and
<pb n="920" facs="tcp:599:544"/> people, that for their faithfulneſſe each to other, each may haue of other this teſtimony; I haue receiued all wholeſome inſtruction from you, I haue receiued all duties cheerefully from you: For maiſter and ſeruant, that for their faithfulnes each to other, each may haue of other this teſtimony, I haue receiued all faithfull ſeruice from you, I haue receiued all that is iuſt and equall from you. But haue thoſe or other like learned this leſſon? I will particularly inſtance onely in one ſort of men, whoſe example beſt fitteth with this we haue in hand. Patrons of Eccleſiaſticall liuings haue the patronage and donation of liuings committed vnto them. The churches of ſeuerall places haue committed that truſt vnto them, to conferre them wholly vpon men willing and fit to diſcharge a good duty in them. But vſe they the like faithfulneſſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> did with <hi>Paul?</hi> Do they giue all that is allotted vnto him, vnto their Clerke whom they preſent? Doth the Miniſter receiue all that the Church aſſigned him from his Patron? Nay I feare me, not many Miniſters can ſay, I haue receiued all that the church gaue me by my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. Many may ſay, I haue receiued by my Patron ſome part of that which the Church allotted vnto me, perhaps the one halfe, perhaps the fourth part, perhaps the tenth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the twentieth part; but all cannot ſay, I haue receiued all. But let ſuch vnfaithfull Patrons as thus neglect to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the truſt repoſed in them, feare, that they ſhall neuer enter into their Maiſters ioy. It is for the good and faithfull ſeruant to enter into his Maiſters ioy; but the bad and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull ſeruant ſhall not enter thereinto.</p>
                  <p>As for vs, (beloued) let vs looke on the example of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paphroditus,</hi> and as he did, ſo let vs labour in all things faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſcharge whatſoeuer truſt is repoſed in vs; that as <hi>Paul</hi> did vnto him, ſo others may giue vnto vs, if neede be, their teſtimony of our faithfulneſſe. If we haue any of the Churches goods in our hands, any orphans goods in our hands, any reliefe by any contribution for any maintenance of any of Gods poore Saints in our hands, or any ſuch like truſt be committed vnto vs, let vs vſe all faithfulneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that euen they whom our faithfulneſſe doth concerne
<pb n="921" facs="tcp:599:544"/> may giue vs that teſtimony, that they haue receiued all that ſhould any way accrew vnto them. But as for the ſinne of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe touching any truſt repoſed in any of vs, let it not be once heard of amongſt vs, as it becommeth Saints; that we may defie all the world to their faces that ſhall, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their heart, ſeeke to faſten any ſuch note vpon vs. Let vs with <hi>Dauid</hi> hate the ſinnes of vnfaithfulneſſe, and let no ſuch cleaue vnto vs: let vs euerie man vſe faithfulneſſe in whatſoeuer truſt is committed to him, and let vs aſſure our ſelues of this, that as the Lord was with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeruant, to bleſſe him for his faithfull ſeruice vnto his maiſter <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſo will he be with vs to bleſſe vs in all our wayes, and in all that we put our hands vnto.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which I note, is the Apoſtles great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with a little. An euident token whereof is this, that he ſaith, <hi>I haue plentie, and am filled.</hi> For wherewith was he filled? With that which came from the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and which he receiued by <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> which, it may be, ſupplied his preſent wants, and ſomewhat more. Yet hauing receiued this, which it is very likely was no great matter, he ſaith, <hi>I haue plentie, and I am filled.</hi> Whence I obſerue a certaine note of good contentment in the true Chriſtian. If with that ſmall or great ſtore wherwith the Lord in mercy hath bleſſed him, he reſt ſo ſatisfied, that he can ſay, I haue plentie, and I am filled; it is an argument of his Chriſtian contentment, and an argument that he is truly rich indeede. For, who more rich then he that is beſt content? or who better content, then he that is ſo ſatisfied with that he hath, as that he ſaith, I haue plentie, and I am filled? If a man ſhall aske the couetous rich man, whether he haue plentie, and be filled; his continuall carking and caring, ſcraping and ſcratching together all that euer he can, will ſpeake for him, and ſay, that he is not full. If a man ſhall aske the rich vſurer, whether he be full, and haue plenty; his continuall eating and deuouring of men by his wicked and vngodly vſurie will ſpeake for him, and ſay, that he is not full. If a man ſhall aske the cruell oppreſſor and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, whether he be full and haue plentie; his continuall grinding of the faces of the poore, and wringing from his
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:599:545"/> brethren whatſoeuer he can, will ſpeake for him, and ſay, that he is not full. It is not great wealth and ſtore that alwayes fills a man, but the more a man hath, the more (oftentimes) he craueth: and the more cauſe he hath to thinke himſelfe filled, the leſſe he thinketh himſelfe filled: and therefore, to be filled, ſtickes not at vſurie, oppreſſion, extortion, bribery, or any vnlawfull and vngodly meanes; and yet neuer is filled, becauſe neuer content with that he hath.</p>
                  <p>Will ye then know (beloued) who they are that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that they haue? will ye haue an euident token of great contentment in a good Chriſtian? Marke where ye heare theſe ſpeeches, I haue enough I thanke God, I haue plenty, I am filled; I am as rich as the Emperour, for he hath but enough, and ſo haue I. It may be that they that thus ſpeake haue not the greateſt wealth in the world, it may be that they haue but, as we ſay, from hand to mouth, or little more; yet theſe are the ſpeeches of them that are content with that they haue, which minde not earthly things, but haue their conuerſation in heauen. Learne therefore to skill of mens contentment in their deſires by the words of their mouth: and looke by what token ye iudge of other mens contentment, let others alſo, by the like tokens in you, iudge likewiſe of your contentment. None more like to be free from vngodly deſires, and attempts by vngodly meanes to be rich, then they that are content with that they haue: neither any more like to be content with that they haue, then they that are ſo ſatisfied with that they haue, as that they thinke and ſay, I haue plenty, I am filled. As therefore we deſire to ſeeme content with that we haue, and to be free from all ſuſpicion of vngodly deſires, and vnlawfull attempts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that we haue, as not content with that we haue; ſo let vs follow our Apoſtle: and as he hauing that which ſupplied his wants, ſaid, <hi>I haue plentie, and I am filled;</hi> ſo whatſoeuer be our ſtore, if we haue but foode and raiment, let vs thinke and ſay that we haue plenty, and that we are filled.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which I note is the acceptableneſſe of the <hi>Philippians</hi> gift vnto God. Which the Apoſtle ſignifieth by a ſpeech borrowed from ſacrifices, the odour wherof ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="923" facs="tcp:599:545"/> ſweete as perſume in the noſtrils of the Lord. Whence I obſerue how acceptable and pleaſant vnto God our workes of charity are generally towards the poore and particularly towards the Miniſters of Chriſt his Goſpel, they are as ſweete ſmelling ſacrifices wherewith the Lord is well pleaſed. It is ſaid that <hi>Noah</hi> after the deluge, <hi>Built an altar vnto the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20.21.</note> 
                     <hi>and tooke of euery cleane beaſt, and of euery cleane fowle and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red burnt offerings vpon the altar;</hi> and it is added, that <hi>the Lord ſmelled a ſauour of reſt;</hi> that is, he accepted his ſacrifice, and was ſo well pleaſed that he ceaſſed from his wrath. So in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of many ſacrifices in Leuiticus, it is often thus added, It is a burnt offering, an oblation made by fire for a ſweete ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnto the Lord. So that our Apoſtle calling our workes of charitie ſacrifice, and ſweete ſmelling odours, euidently ſheweth thereby how acceptable and pleaſant they are vnto God. Such a ſacrifice <hi>Obadiah</hi> offered vp vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 18.4.</note> when he hid the Lord his Prophets by fifties in a caue from the furie of <hi>Iezebel,</hi> and fed them with bread and water. Such a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> offered vp vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 38.13.</note> when he got <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> the Lord his Prophet out of priſon, where he was caſt into the dungeon, and dead almoſt with hunger. Such a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the houſe of <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> offered vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16.</note> when he ſought out our Apoſtle diligently, and found him, and often refreſhed him, and was not aſhamed of his chaine. Theſe all in their charitable works for the Prophets and Miniſters of the Lord offered vp ſweete ſmelling odours, and ſacrifices accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and pleaſant vnto God. Such a ſacrifice likewiſe the Churches of Macedonia offered vnto the Lord, when in their extreme pouerty they were richly liberall to the reliefe of the poore Saints at Ieruſalem. And with ſuch ſacrifices whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they are offered God is well pleaſed, as witneſſeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, where he exhorteth to ſuch ſacrifice: <hi>To do good,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16.</note> ſaith he, <hi>and to diſtribute, forget not: for with ſuch ſacrifice God is well pleaſed.</hi> Yea he keepeth the good deeds of a man as the apple of his eye, and the almes of a man is as a thing ſealed vp before him. Yea looke whatſoeuer good he doth vnto the poore,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 17.20.</note> the Lord ſhall recompence it him againe into his owne boſome.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 19.17.</note> For the day ſhall come wherein it ſhall be ſaid vnto ſuch
<pb n="924" facs="tcp:599:546"/> workers of charitie,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34.</note> 
                     <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherite ye the kingdome prepared for you from the foundations of the world, for I was an hungred, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then firſt learne what the Chriſtian ſacrifice is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal God is well pleaſed. The ſacrifices of the old Law they are now aboliſhed and done away, euen ſince our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour gaue himſelfe for vs to be an offering and a ſacrifice of a ſweete ſmelling ſauour vnto God. Other incenſes and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which now in many places are offered and ſacrificed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to idols and images they are an abhomination vnto the Lord. It is not perfumes in temples, burning of incenſe vnto Saints, ſacrificing vnto ſtocks and ſtones, or hoaſts vpon the altars, that are acceptable and pleaſing vnto God. Nay he that doth theſe things is as if he cut off a dogs necke, as if he offered ſwines bloud, as if he bleſſed an idoll: nay he is an idolater, and he is an abomination vnto the Lord. If we will be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing, the Chriſtian ſacrifice which we muſt offer vnto the Lord to be a ſweete ſmelling ſauour vnto him, muſt be the offering of the calues of our lips, euen the ſacrifice of praiſe &amp; thankſgiuing for ſuch his louing mercies as he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed vnto vs; or elſe the offering of our ſelues a liuing ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, holy, acceptable vnto God, which is our reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God; or elſe the offering of our goods in a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deuotion to the poore afflicted members of Chriſt Ieſus. Theſe ſacrifices are commended vnto vs by the Apoſtles of Chriſt Ieſus;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15.</note> the firſt where it is ſaid, <hi>Let vs by Ieſus offer the ſacrifice of praiſe alwaies vnto God; that is, the fruite of our lippes which confeſſe his name:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</note> the ſecond where it is ſaid, <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the mercies of God, that ye giue vp your bodies a liuing ſacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reaſonable ſeruing of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16.</note> the third where it is ſaid, <hi>To do good, and to diſtribute forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifice God is well pleaſed.</hi> And theſe are the alone ſacrifice left vnto Chriſtians to offer, which are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſant vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let vs hence learne to ſtriue euery man to go one before another in doing good vnto all the afflicted members of Chriſt Ieſus. It is a ſacrifice acceptable and pleaſant vnto God, witneſſe the Apoſtle here. It is more accepted with God
<pb n="925" facs="tcp:599:546"/> then all burnt offerings and ſacrifice, witneſſe the Prophet.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.7.</note> It ſhall further their reckoning in the day of Chriſt Ieſus; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Apoſtle in the words before. It ſhall bring with it great recompence of reward through the promiſe made of God vnto vs in Chriſt Ieſus; witneſſe our bleſſed Sauiour.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.</note> Let vs therefore as the Apoſtle exhorteth, <hi>While we haue time do good vnto all men, but ſpecially vnto them which are of the houſehold of faith.</hi> Let vs, as <hi>Daniel</hi> counſelled <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>

                     <hi>Binde mercie and truth vpon our neckes, and write them vpon the tables of our hearts.</hi> Let all hard-heartednes be farre from vs, and let the bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion be kindled within vs ſo often as we behold the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed members of Chriſt Ieſus. The law commandeth merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and compaſſion euen vnto the poore beaſts. How much more ſhould we that are members one of another, we that are members of the myſtical body of Chriſt Ieſus, deale merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one with another, and be feruent in charity one towards another. Beloued, let vs conſider our ſelues? and prouoke one another vnto euery good worke. He that hath bene ſlacke let him be no more ſlacke, and he that hath bene forward this way let him be forward ſtill. The day approcheth when we muſt all appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man may receiue the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or euill. Let vs therefore make vs friends of the vnrighteous mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, &amp; let vs lay vp for our ſelues treaſure in heauen, whither neither ruſt nor moth corrupteth, and where theeues do not breake through nor ſteale. And this ſhall we do, if as God hath bleſſed vs we giue vnto the poore, and take pity &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the fatherleſſe and afflicted.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd my God ſhall, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtles commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Philippians</hi> liberalitie we haue heard, which was this; Firſt that in it ſelfe it was ſuch as that after he had receiued it, he had plentie, and was filled; Secondly, that it was a ſweete ſmelling odour, a ſacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſant vnto God. Now vnto this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Apoſtle addeth a promiſe of recompence of reward for their liberalitie, and ſo concludeth the Epiſtle with praiſe and thankſgiuing vnto the Lord. In verſe 19. where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, firſt I note the Author of the recompence promiſed, which is God, whom the Apoſtle in great ſtrength of faith calleth his God, both for his owne comfort, and for the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> encouragement. Secondly, I note what recompence is promiſed, which is, that his God ſhall fulfill all their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; wherein he alludeth to that he had ſaid in the former verſe, that as he was filled by them, &amp; all his neceſſities ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through their liberalitie, ſo his God ſhould fulfill all their neceſſities, and ſupply all their wants. Thirdly, I note the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of making this recompence, which appeareth to be eaſie becauſe God is rich: <hi>My God ſhall fulfill all your neceſſities through his riches.</hi> Fourthly, I note the fulneſſe of the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence promiſed vnto their liberalitie, in that it is ſaid that he <hi>ſhall fulfill all their neceſſities through his riches with glorie;</hi> all, with glorie, that is, ſo plentifully and abundantly, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that it ſhall be to the glorie of his name. Laſtly, I note the cauſe wherefore, or the meanes wherby ſuch recompence ſhall be made, which is Chriſt Ieſus, in whom, and for whom, and through whom we haue and receiue both all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and all the bleſſings for this life, and for that that is to
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:599:547"/> come, <hi>My God ſhall fulfill, &amp;c. with glorie in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> The ſumme then of theſe words is this, as if he had thus ſaid: As I haue plentie, and am filled by you, ſo that all my wants are ſupplyed; ſo my God that helpeth me and comforteth me in all my troubles, my God that ſeeth and regardeth your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards me, ſhall for a full recompence of reward fulfill all your neceſſities, and ſupply all your wants through his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches plentifully to the glorie of his name, not for the merit of your worke, but in and for Ieſus Chriſt, in whom, and for whom, you and your workes are accepted. This I take to be the meaning of theſe words. Now let vs ſee what notes we may gather hence for our farther inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing which here I note is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>My God, &amp;c.</hi> which is not ſpoken by way of excluding them, as if he were not their God alſo, but partly out of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull might of his ſauing faith, partly to comfort himſelfe in the middeſt of all his troubles, partly to note his vpholding ſtay in all his troubles, and partly to imply vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> that what they had giuen vnto him they had giuen vnto God. For ſo it will appeare, if the ſpeech be well obſerued, that ſuch neare application hath alwaies ſuch ſignification. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, The Lord is my rocke and my fortreſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.2.</note> 
                     <hi>and he that deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me, my God, and my ſtrength, my ſhield, the horne of my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my refuge.</hi> So <hi>Eſay, O Lord thou art my God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 25.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.48.</note> 
                     <hi>I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt thee, and I will praiſe thy name.</hi> So our bleſſed Sauiour, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> In which and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like places, where the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and our bleſſed Sauiour do vſe theſe particular ſpeeches of, <hi>My Lord, my God,</hi> and the like, they do not vſe them as thereby ſingling out vnto themſelues a peculiar God, but in ſome ſuch like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as before was mentioned, to wit, either through the great ſtrength of their faith, or for their comfort in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or to note their vpholding ſtay in their afflictions, or elſe to imply the communication vnto Gods Saints to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication vnto God. Whence I obſerue that ſuch ſpeeches are no note of ſingularitie, no ſpeeches to be either ſcorned or reproued in them that vſe them with reuerence &amp; in feare. Which I obſerue becauſe of them that vpon the hearing of
<pb n="928" facs="tcp:599:548"/> ſuch ſpeeches, are ſtraight way readie to brand him that vſeth them with ſome new name of Puritane, or Preciſian, or the like; and in ſcorne to aske him who is his God, who is his Lord, and whether he haue any peculiar God which is not our God, and our Lord. Of whom I aske againe, whether the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and our bleſſed Sauiour which vſed theſe ſpeeches, were Puritanes, or Preciſians, or the like? If they were, why is it obiected vnto any man that he is? if they notwithſtanding theſe ſpeeches were not, why vpon the like ſpeeches is any man iudged to be? Shall any man aske of any of them, who is his God, or who is his Lord, or whether he haue any peculiar God? Why ſhould then any ſuch queſtion vpon the like occaſion be made? It may very well be that they who now aske ſuch queſtions, if <hi>Paul</hi> were now liuing, and now ſpake or wrote thus, would aske him the like que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
                  <p>Wherein learne a notable policie of the Diuell. He ſeeth the great ſtay, and the great comfort that the child of God hath, when he comes ſo farre as that with boldneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence he can ſay, my God, and my Lord. He ſeeth that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer troubles do preſſe vs, whatſoeuer ſcorners do blow vpon vs, howſoeuer he ſeeke continually like a roaring Lion to deuoure vs, yet nothing can caſt vs downe, if through the powerfull might of a ſauing faith we can ſay, my God, and my Lord. He ſeeth that to come ſo neare vnto God, as to call him my God and my Lord, is to depart too farre from him. And therefore he laboureth againſt this boldneſſe and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and neare approch: and to this purpoſe hath deuiſed to brand them with odious names that ſhall at any time ſo ſpeake. Neither yet doth my ſpeech tend to perſwade the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary vſe of thoſe ſpeeches, my God, and my Lord. For our bleſſed Sauiour hath taught vs to pray, Our Father which art in heauen, and I know that our moſt vſuall ſpeeches of our Lord, and our God, are moſt holy, and moſt Chriſtian. Onely this I ſay, that it ought not to be preiudiciall vnto any man, if at any time he ſay, my God, and my Lord. He may ſometimes vſe them, and yet ought nor therefore either to be noted of ſingularitie, or to be ſcorned or reprooued. Let them conſider
<pb n="929" facs="tcp:599:548"/> what I ſay, that are ſo readie vpon ſuch occaſions to brand men with names that they know not what they meane, &amp; let vs in no ſort follow their example. Let vs ioyne with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſay, Our God, and our Lord; but let vs not ſcorne or reproch them that ſay, My God, or my Lord. Nay, let vs know, that nor we, nor any can haue any greater ſtay or comfort then in this, that the Lord is his God, and his Lord. Thus much of this note by the way.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I note, is, what recompence of reward the Apoſtle promiſeth vnto the <hi>Philippians</hi> for their liberalitie towards him. The promiſe is this, that as he was filled by them, and all his neceſſities ſupplied by their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, ſo God ſhould fulfill all their neceſſities through his riches with glorie. Whence I obſerue this leſſon for vs, that looke what good we do vnto Gods Saints here on earth, God ſhall recompence the ſame into our boſomes, both with bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in this life, and likewiſe in that that is to come. Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we the poore and needie in the needeful time of trouble? the recompence is,<note place="margin">

                  <p>A great mercy of our gracious God, to promiſe or to pay
<pb n="930" facs="tcp:599:549"/> ſuch recompence of reward vnto our workes; and a notable inducement to ſtirre vs vp vnto all workes of charitie. The ſame motiue the <hi>Preacher</hi> alſo vſeth, where he ſaith, <hi>Caſt thy bread vpon the waters,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.1.</note> 
                     <hi>for after many dayes thou ſhalt finde it:</hi> Caſt thy bread vpon the waters, that is, breake thy bread vnto the hungrie, be mercifull and liberall vnto the poore; though thy almes may ſeeme to be caſt vpon the waters, though it may ſeeme that thou ſhalt neuer haue thankes or ought elſe for that good thou doeſt: (for ſo too many thinke, that what they giue vnto the poore, they commit vnto a dead hand, that it periſheth, that afterwards there is no remembrance of it:) yet ſaith he, Caſt thy bread vpon the waters. And why? he addeth a promiſe of mercie that ſhall follow vpon it, for after many dayes thou ſhalt finde it, that is, thy gift ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but thy God ſhall recompence it thee into thy boſome. Thou ſhalt finde it in thy basket, and in thy dough, and in the fruite of thy body, and the fruite of thy ground, in the fruite of thy cattell, in the increaſe of thy kine, and in the flockes of thy ſheepe; or if not in theſe temporall bleſſings, yet in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces; or if not now for a ſeaſon, yet after many dayes, as the husbandman receiueth the increaſe of his corne, which when it was firſt ſowne might ſeeme to haue periſhed; or if not in this life, yet certainely in the heauens when the Lord ſhall wipe all teares from thine eyes, and crowne thee with glorie and immortalitie. Here is then another kinde of reaſoning then thy carnall ſence and reaſon teacheth thee to make. Thou thinkeſt that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way to be rich, is to be ſparing, to hold faſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.25.</note> to giue away nothing that thou canſt ſaue. But as our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>He that loueth his life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> So I ſay, he that thus loueth his riches ſhall not be rich: but the way to keepe and to increaſe riches, is to beſtow them on the poore. Where they ſeeme to be loſt, there they ſhal be found; where they ſeeme to be caſt vpon the waters, there they ſhalbe laid vp in heauen, where neither ruſt nor moath corrupt, and where theeues do not breake through nor ſteale.</p>
                  <p>Why is it then that the bowells of our compaſſion are ſhut vp againſt the poore? for in many places the poore crie, and none helpeth them, they faint in the ſtreets and none ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coureth
<pb n="931" facs="tcp:599:549"/> them, they mourne in their ſoules and none comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, they periſh for want of foode, and none relieueth them. I perſwade my ſelfe that it is not altogether thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs: but in many places it is thus. And what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Verily our diffidence and diſtruſt is the cauſe of all this. We ſee not how we ſhall haue ſufficiencie for our ſelues if we be bountifull vnto others: we ſee not but we ſhall want our ſelues if thus we do ſupplie the wants of others; and though it may be we dare not openly ſpeake vnto the point, of Gods promiſe of a recompence of reward vnto whatſoeuer we do vnto his poore Saints here on earth, yet do we thinke with our ſelues that if we ſhould relie much vpon this, we might quickly bring our ſelues vnto the beggers ſtaffe, and then who would pitie vs? Thus though the promiſe be made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs of fulfilling all our neceſſities, yet ſuch is our blindneſſe that we cannot ſee, and ſuch our diſtruſtfulneſſe that wee doubt how our neceſſities ſhall be fulfilled, and therefore we hold backe, and do not ſtretch out our hands vnto the poore and needie.</p>
                  <p>Our Apoſtle therefore to meete with this doubtfulneſſe, telleth vs that God that maketh this promiſe vnto vs is rich, and he will fulfill all our neceſſities through his riches. If a poore man make a large promiſe of great bountifulneſſe, we may well doubt how he will be able to make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But if a rich man make ſuch a promiſe, eſpecially being a good man, and one that is wont to keepe promiſe, who will make any doubt of the performance of his promiſe? Now our God that vnto our workes of charitie hath made this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to fulfill all our neceſſities, is rich.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.10.12</note> 
                     <hi>For all the beaſts of the forreſt are his, and ſo are the cattell vpon a thouſand hils: the whole world is his, and all that is therein. The eies of all waite vpon him,</hi>

                     <hi>and he giues them their meate in due ſeaſon; he openeth his hand, and filleth all things liuing with plenteouſneſſe.</hi> All riches of grace and glorie, of this life, and of that that is to come, are with him, and vnto whom he will he giueth them. And therefore the Apoſtle telleth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8.</note> 
                     <hi>God is able to make all grace to abound toward you, that ye alwaies hauing all ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in all things, may abound in euerie good worke.</hi> The <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                     <pb n="932" facs="tcp:599:550"/> they did as we do, they feared that if they ſhould giue much to the reliefe of the poore Saints, they ſhould impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh themſelues thereby. For they thought, that whatſoeuer was giuen to others, was taken from themſelues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gaue, when they gaue, very ſparingly, and nothing chearefully. Whereupon the Apoſtle tels them, that God is able, to wit, through his riches, to make all grace to abound towards them; that is, to repay them all that they haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with aduantage, that they might haue enough both for themſelues, and alſo to helpe others withall. So rich is our God that he can, and ſo good is our God that he will do thus vnto all them that ſow liberally, and giue chearefully. And why ſhould any man doubt of this? When thou ſoweſt thy come in the ground, doeſt thou not hope to receiue thine owne againe with aduantage? and doeſt thou not reape of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes a great deale more then thou diddeſt ſow? Why then ſhouldeſt thou doubt after thy diſperſing to the poore to reape ſeuen fold more for it? Why ſhouldeſt thou not hope to receiue thine owne againe with very great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?</p>
                  <p>Conſidering theſe things, beloued, let it be farre from vs to doubt that pouertie will follow our liberalitie. Let vs not thinke with our ſelues that the more we giue the leſſe we haue, but rather that the more we giue the more through his riches we ſhall haue. Let the poore therefore be our field wherein we ſow our corne, and ſurely we ſhall reape plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: let the poore be our altar whereon we make our offering, and then ſurely our ſacrifice ſhall be acceptable and pleaſant vnto God: let the poore be our chiſt wherein to hourd our treaſure, and this ſhall ſurely further our reckoning in the day of Chriſt Ieſus. If our liberality abound according to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to the poore, our God ſhall fulfill all our neceſſities through his riches, yea he ſhall fulfill them with glory, euen with ſuch plentifulneſſe and abundance as that his name may be glorified thereby.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which I note is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that their recompence of reward was in Chriſt Ieſus. Whereby he giueth them to vnderſtand that God made this recompence
<pb n="933" facs="tcp:599:550"/> of reward vnto them of their liberality towards him, not for their works ſake as vpon deſert, but for Chriſt Ieſus ſake one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by grace. Whence I obſerue how the promiſes of God touching the recompence of reward for our works, are made good vnto vs; the promiſes are made and payed only in Chriſt Ieſus, not any way for the merit of our works ſeene or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene. In him God from the beginning loued vs, and made all his louing promiſes of his ſweete mercies vnto vs, and in him partly now he doth, &amp; partly hereafter ſhall make them good vnto vs through his riches with glory. This our Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth where he ſaith,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2.</note> that <hi>all the promiſes of God in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus are yea, and are in him Amen;</hi> that is, in him they are all made and performed, ratified and eſtabliſhed. And the reaſon is plaine; for why doth he make or performe ſuch promiſes vnto vs, but onely in his gracious loue and fauour towards vs, euery promiſe of his vnto vs being a teſtimonie of his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs? And how doth he loue vs but onely in Chriſt Ieſus, in whom alone he is well pleaſed?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17.</note> His promiſes then vnto vs being made and performed onely in loue vnto vs, &amp; his loue vnto vs being onely in Chriſt Ieſus, it is plaine that all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made and performed vnto vs in Chriſt Ieſus alone. By him we are reconciled vnto God, and in him, through him, and for him we haue whatſoeuer we haue. So that whenſoeuer any promiſe is made vnto vs throughout the whole Scripture, either of bleſſing for this life, or for that that is to come, of temporall or of eternall reward, of ſafetie from enemies, or of ſaluation in the heauens; ſtill we are to lift vp our eyes vnto heauen where Chriſt Ieſus ſitteth at the right hand of God, &amp; to know that in him alone both the promiſe is made, and ſhall be performed vnto vs, through the loue of God wherewith he loueth vs in him.</p>
                  <p>Hence then, firſt, we learne not to credit any ſuch as ſhall tell vs that any reward is promiſed or giuen vnto vs for the merit or worth of our works ſeene or foreſeene. For let but this ground be laid, which is moſt certaine and true, that all the promiſes of God vnto vs are made and performed in Chriſt Ieſus; then muſt it needs be concluded, that in vs no merits or any thing were ſeene or foreſeene, wherefore ſuch promiſes
<pb n="934" facs="tcp:599:551"/> ſhould be made or performed, and that we are altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie in our ſelues vnto whom any ſuch promiſes ſhould be made or performed. For therefore are they made and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe in vs there is nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould be performed or made. Or if there be, then as the Apoſtle reaſoneth touching iuſtification, ſaying, <hi>If righteouſneſſe be by the Law;</hi> that is, by the works of the Law, <hi>then Chriſt died without a cauſe;</hi> ſo do I touching this point, If in vs there be any thing wherefore the promiſes of God ſhould be made or performed, then in vaine are they made and performed in Chriſt Ieſus. I omit to ſpeake of the great vnworthineſſe of our beſt works, becauſe I haue ſpoken to that purpoſe often heretofore. Onely for this time let this ground be conſidered, and if any man at any time ſhall ſeeke to perſwade you that this or that reward is promiſed and ſhall be giuen vnto you for the merit of your works, tell him that it is promiſed and giuen vnto you in Chriſt Ieſus, and therefore not for any merit of your works.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence learne the ſtableneſſe of all Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made vnto his children. As this here is, ſo they are all made in Chriſt Ieſus, and therefore muſt needs be ſtable and neuer faile. Euen as we ſay, that whom he loueth once he loueth vnto the end, becauſe whom he loueth in Chriſt Ieſus, him he alwaies loueth; ſo his promiſes being all founded and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon his loue, once made vnto his children ſhall not faile for euer, becauſe they are all made in Chriſt Ieſus. A notable comfort vnto all Gods children. Hath he promiſed life and ſaluation vnto all that beleeue in his name? hath he promiſed deliuerance out of troubles vnto thoſe that loue &amp; feare him? hath he promiſed to fulfill all their neceſſities that ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the poore? Here is the comfort that not one of theſe promiſes ſhall faile for euer, becauſe they are all made in Chriſt Ieſus, in whom he loueth vs for euer, and therefore keepeth his promiſes made in him vnto vs for euer. Let vs not therefore faile of what he requireth of vs, and aſſuredly he will not faile of whatſoeuer he hath promiſed vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence learne that the promiſes made of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely vnto them that are in Chriſt Ieſus. The proofe
<pb n="935" facs="tcp:599:551"/> whereof is this, becauſe the promiſes made of God are onely made in Chriſt Ieſus: ſo that vntill ſuch time as we be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in Chriſt Ieſus, and made one with him, we are meere ſtrangers from the couenants of promiſe, and quite aliants from the commonwealth of Iſrael. Holy things are not for dogs, nor pearles for ſwine, nor the childrens bread for whelpes: his faithfull oath is vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede, and his holy promiſes vnto them that be at peace with him. And who are at peace with him but they that are in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus his Sonne, by whom we are reconciled vnto him? In vaine therefore do they looke after the promiſe that beare not fruite in the true vine Chriſt Ieſus. Worldly bleſſings they may haue, and that in abundance.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45.</note> 
                     <hi>For he maketh his Sunne to ariſe on the euill, and on the good, and ſendeth raine on the iuſt and vniuſt.</hi> But the ſure promiſes of grace and glory are vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> his people, and to <hi>Iſrael</hi> his inheritance. Will we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take comfort in his promiſes? The Spirit muſt witneſſe vnto our ſpirit that we are in Chriſt Ieſus. Will we lay hold on the promiſes as belonging vnto vs? So we may, if in the aſſurance of our ſoules we can crie, Abba, Father. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we loue and long to be partakers of the promiſes, ſo let vs in all things grow vp into him, which is the head, that is, Chriſt. Let vs be mercifull as our heauenly Father is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and let vs do good vnto all, but eſpecially vnto them that are of the houſhold of faith. If we communicate vnto the neceſſities of the Saints, the Lord our God ſhall fulfill all our neceſſities through his riches with glorie in Chriſt Ieſus. This promiſe is ſure, becauſe made in Chriſt Ieſus, and belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto vs if we be in Chriſt Ieſus, and walke worthy of Chriſt Ieſus, abounding in this, and euery good worke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day of Chriſt Ieſus. Now one word of that wherewith the Apoſtle concludeth his Epiſtle, ſaying, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God, euen the Father, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle concludeth the Epiſtle, with praiſe and thankſgiuing vnto the Lord. Where firſt I note that now he ſaith, <hi>our God.</hi> Before he ſaid, <hi>my God;</hi> now, <hi>our God.</hi> So that howſoeuer more ſcruple be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the one, then the other, yet ye ſee there is warrant for
<pb n="936" facs="tcp:599:552"/> both, to vſe this or that ſpeech as the occaſions are. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I note that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>our Father.</hi> Not any but Chriſt alone ſaith, <hi>my Father.</hi> He when he ſpeaketh of himſelfe ſaith, <hi>my Father;</hi> when he ſpeaketh of vs ſaith, <hi>your Father,</hi> as that place witneſſeth where he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.17.</note> 
                     <hi>I aſcend vnto my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your Father, and to my God, and your God.</hi> He can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, my Father, becauſe he alone is his Sonne by eternall generation; we onely can ſay, our father, becauſe we are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his ſonnes by Adoption through Chriſt Ieſus, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by his Spirit. Thirdly, I note that here he is called our God in reſpect of our creation, and our Father in reſpect of our regeneration: our God in reſpect of temporall, our Father in reſpect of eternall bleſſings. Now vnto God euen our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for both, euen for all be praiſe for euermore; that is, throughout all ages from generation to generation, that as his mercies endure for euer, ſo his name may be bleſſed and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for euer.</p>
                  <p>Whence I obſerue, that alwaies in all things God euen our Father is to be praiſed; write we, or ſpeake we, remember we, or mention we temporall bleſſings, or ſpirituall graces, ſtill he is to be praiſed. And the reaſon is; For of him, and through him, and for him are all things. In all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs glorifie God through Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; let vs alwaies haue that ſong in our mouthes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Praiſe, and glorie, and thanks, and honour, and power, and might be vnto our God for euermore, Amen.</hi> And as our Apoſtle concludeth this his Epiſtle with praiſe vnto the Lord, ſo let vs remember to praiſe our God for that it hath pleaſed him ſo often to aſſemble vs together to heare a great part of this Epiſtle opened vnto vs, and thence to be inſtructed in the things that belong vnto our peace. The beginning of this worke was his doing, and the continuance of this worke is his doing. Vnto him therefore euen God our Father be praiſe for euermore, Amen.</p>

In theſe words therefore now read, we haue the concluſion of this whole Epiſtle. Where firſt he concludeth the Epiſtle with praiſe and thankſgiuing vnto the Lord. Secondly, he addeth, as his manner is, certaine ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Firſt for concluſion of the Epiſtle he ſaith, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen our Father, &amp;c.</hi> or, vnto our God and our Father, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our vnto both, as vſually it is wont.</p>
                  <p>Where firſt I note vnto whom all praiſe is due, euen vnto God our Father, our God, and our Father. And here by the way firſt I note that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto our God.</hi> In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe he ſaid, <hi>my God,</hi> now he ſaith, <hi>our God.</hi> So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer more ſcruple be made about the one then about the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeech, the one being vſed and approued by all, the other being ſcorned and reproued by many, yet ye ſee there is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for both; and as the occaſions are, ſo we may vſe this or that ſpeech, vnles we will take vpon vs either to cenſure the Apoſtle for vſing as well the one as the other; or thinke that the Apoſtles example may not be our warrant to vſe as well the one as the other. It is, as I told you the laſt day, the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Diuell, to the end that he may ſtay men from this boldneſſe and confidence, and neare approch vnto God, as to call him my God and my Lord, to brand them with moſt
<pb n="938" facs="tcp:599:553"/> odious names, and to heape on them moſt opprobrious ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that ſhall at any time ſo ſpeake. But if we keepe the true patterne of the moſt wholeſome words which we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of our Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note> as he willeth vs, it is warrant enough for vs; and if we do ſo, whatſoeuer opprobrious name or ſpeech is caſt vpon vs, lights as well vpon him as vpon vs, and ſo long we neede not much to moue or trouble our ſelues thereat. The ſecond thing which here by the way I note is, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God, euen our Father.</hi> God he is the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and he is the Father of vs all. And hereupon he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.17.</note> 
                     <hi>I aſcend vnto my Father and your Father, vnto my God and your God.</hi> But not any but Chriſt alone when he ſpeaketh of God, can ſay, my Father. The reaſon is in the difference of the manner how he and we are called ſonnes. For in a large different manner are he and we called ſonnes: he, by eternall generation of the ſubſtance of the Father, we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Adoption through Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by his Spirit; he the onely begotten Sonne of God by nature, we all the ſonnes of God, not by nature but by grace; nor onely as the Angels in reſpect of our creation, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our Adoption and regeneration. Albeit therefore one God be the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the Father of vs all, yet becauſe of this different manner, how he is his and our Father, we cannot ſay as he, my Father, but onely our Father. Neither is it obſerued that any ſaith with Chriſt, my Father,<note place="margin">28.</note> as many ſay with <hi>Thomas, my Lord and my God.</hi> The third thing which by the way I note is, that in this and other like places where theſe ſpeeches are thus ioyned together, our God is mentioned in reſpect of our creation, and our Father in reſpect of our regeneration; our God in reſpect of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſings, and our Father in reſpect of ſpirituall graces, and eternall in the heauens. For as our God he created vs and made vs, but as our Father he adopted and redeemed vs by Chriſt, and renewed vs by his Spirit; as our God he gaue vs life, motion, and being; but as our Father he maketh vs to liue vnto his praiſe, to walke after the Spirit, and to be new creatures. So that the ioy and comfort of our ſoules is this, that our God is our Father, euen our mercifull and louing
<pb n="939" facs="tcp:599:553"/> God, and tendereth vs as his ſonnes and heires of his promiſes. Theſe things I thought good to note by the way, by occaſion of the firſt note which here offereth it ſelfe, viz. vnto whom all praiſe is due, namely vnto God, euen our Father.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I note is, the thing which is due vnto him, which is, glory, and honour, and praiſe, and thankſgiuing; as witneſſe alſo the foure and twentie Elders ſaying, <hi>Thou art worthie, O Lord, to receiue glorie, and honour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>and power: For thou haſt created all things, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing which I note, is, the continuance of the time during which this praiſe is to be giuen vnto him, which is for euermore; that is, throughout all ages from generation to generation. The reaſon of which euerlaſting continuance is, not onely becauſe of his eternall maieſtie and glorie, but ſpecially becauſe of his euerlaſting mercy and loue, that as his mercies endure for euer, ſo his name may be bleſſed and praiſed for euer. Many notes ye ſee might hence eaſily be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and not vnfruitfully inſiſted vpon: as firſt, from the perſon vnto whom all praiſes is due, viz. not vnto Saints, or Angels, much leſſe vnto brutiſh or ſenſleſſe creatures, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God onely, euen vnto God our Father. Secondly, from the thing which is, due vnto him, which is, praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, not with lips alone, but from the heart and ſoule; which is the ſweeteſt ſmelling ſacrifice that can be offered vnto the Lord. Thirdly, from the time, that his praiſe is not to be temporarie but euerlaſting, as his mercies are euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
                  <p>But for this time my meaning is to conclude all theſe in one ſhort obſeruation which is this, That alwaies in all things God euen our Father is to be praiſed: write we, or ſpeake we, remember we with our ſelues, or mention we vnto others temporall bleſſings, or ſpirituall graces, for this life preſent, or for that that is to come, ſtill he is to be praiſed. And to this the Apoſtles giue witneſſe in euery place. Our Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

<pb n="940" facs="tcp:599:554"/> in the Church by Ieſus Chriſt throughout all generations for euer, Amen.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.</note> And againe, <hi>Vnto the King euerlaſting, immortall, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, vnto God onely wiſe, be honour and glorie for euer and euer, Amen.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 11.</note> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Let God in all things be glorified through Ieſus Chriſt, to whom is praiſe and dominion for euer and euer, Amen.</hi> In which teſtimonies, to omit infinite others which might be brought to this purpoſe, ye ſee alſo the practiſe of the Apoſtles, that alwaies in all things they praiſed the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing and onely wiſe God. And the reaſon why it ſhould be ſo is euident and cleare, as the foure and twenty Elders yeeld it, where they caſt their crownes before him and ſay, <hi>Thou art worthie O Lord to receiue glorie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.11.</note>

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36.</note> Or as our Apoſtle yeeldeth the reaſon; <hi>Of him, and through him, and for him are all things; to him therefore be glorie for euer, Amen.</hi> But not to ſeeke after other reaſons then our preſent text affoordeth: he is our God that hath created vs, formed vs, and made vs for his glorie: he is our Father, which hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſings in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in Chriſt, and his mercies towards vs in Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne are for euermore; therfore alwaies and in all things his name is to be bleſſed and praiſed.</p>
                  <p>But who is he that knowes not this, that God is alwaies in all things to be praiſed, and that there is great cauſe ſo to do? If the queſtion be asked, one thing will be anſwered; but if the practiſe be looked into, another thing may bee iudged.<note place="margin">

If ten lepers be clenſed amongſt vs of their leproſie, are there not nine of them that neuer returne backe to giue God praiſe? ten for one that neuer praiſe the Lord for his mercies? May not the Lord now take vp the complaint of <hi>Malachie,</hi> and ſay, <hi>A ſonne honoreth his father, and a ſeruant his maiſter. If I then be a Father where is mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?

If I then be your God, where is my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? If I be your Father, where is mine honour? I doubt not
<pb n="941" facs="tcp:599:554"/> but there are who with the Prophet ſay, <hi>Thou art my God,</hi>

We haue certaine words of courſe which we vſe, as to ſay, God be bleſſed, God be praiſed, I thanke God, I praiſe God; but commonly they come but from the lippes.

I tell you, in that ye haue profaned his holy Sabboths. And if ye ſay vnto me, Wherein haue we profaned them? I tell you out of the Prophet, In that therein ye haue done your owne wil, and not the wil of the Lord? For, not to ſpeake of your abſenting of your ſelues, ſome of you, from your Churches on that day, when ye ſhould come thither (as it were) to his Schoole, there to heare his voice, to learne his moſt holie will, and to be inſtructed in the things that belong vnto our peace; not to ſpeake of your fruitleſſe and vnneceſſarie tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, on that day, in your houſes, or at your doores, or as ye walke abroad, when ye ſhould either meditate with your ſelues, or conferre with others of the things that ye haue heard at the Church out of the word; not to ſpeake of your running vp and downe with your wares, of your ſelling of your wares euen in open ſhop, and of doing the workes of your calling on the Sabboth day, when ye ſhould be either preparing your ſelues in all holie reuerence to the hearing of the word, or elſe be preſent in the congregation at the hearing of the word, or elſe be meditating or conferring of the things that ye haue heard; not, I ſay, to ſpeake of theſe and many ſuch like things whereby the Lord his Sabboths are profaned, in that your owne wil is onely done, and the Lord his wil neglected; what wil ye ſay vnto piping, and dancing, and drinking, and lording, and ladying, and may-gaming on that day? Is this the Lord his will, or is it your owne
<pb n="942" facs="tcp:599:555"/> will? Nay, is it not to oppoſe your ſelues againſt his will? He requires of you on that day to do his will, and not your owne will; but ye do your owne will, and not his will. Can ye pleade ignorance in this behalfe? Nay, ye haue bin taught what is his will for this day, and that this is not his will, but as much repugnant to his will almoſt as can be. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is your ſinne the greater, becauſe being taught in theſe things ye haue refuſed to hearken and to obey, and choſen rather to follow the wayes of your owne heart. O but ye tooke onelie the euening vnto theſe delights. Yea but the euening is a part of the Lords day, wherein he looketh to be ſerued as well as ye looke to be ſerued by your ſeruants on the working daies in the euening. The whole day is to be conſecrated vnto the Lord; ſo that that whole day we ought to employ, either in an holie preparation to his ſeruice, or in hearing, or reading, or meditating, or conferring of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie word of God, and not otherwiſe. What? no honeſt recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and delights lawfull on that day? Firſt, theſe whereof we now ſpeake are not ſuch, but vnhoneſt and vngodly. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for thoſe that are ſuch, it is doubted whether they be lawfull on that day. For if worldly but neceſſarie duties be forbidden when we ſhould attend on the Lords worke, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot be wholly occupied in both,) much more things which ſeeme but for pleaſure, are then to be abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Beloued, being occaſioned at this time to ſpeake of our diſhonouring of God, whom we ought to praiſe and honour alwayes, and in all things, I haue inſtanced onely in this one point of our diſhonouring of God, both becauſe the profanation of the Sabboth is one of the greateſt diſhonours of God, and one wherein we too too much, and too too groſſely offend.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Salute all the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> Now in the end of this Epiſtle the Apoſtle addeth ſalutations from himſelfe and others vnto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> which manner alſo he vſeth almoſt in the end of all his Epiſtles. And firſt he remembreth his owne ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto them, ſaying, <hi>Salute all the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, he remembreth the ſalutations of his brethren, and fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Goſpell vnto them, ſaying, <hi>The brethren, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, he remembreth the ſalutations of all the reſt of the Saints that were at <hi>Rome</hi> vnto them, ſaying. <hi>All the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> Laſtly he ſhutteth vp all and ſealeth, as it were his letter with that vſuall prayer which he vſeth both in the beginning and in the end of all his Epiſtles, ſaying, <hi>The grace, &amp;c.</hi> Salute, ſometimes he addeth the manner, with an holy kiſſe. For that was the manner of the Chriſtian ſalutation to embrace one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and to kiſſe one another. Salute then in token of my loue and affection vnto them, all the Saints generally; nor onely ſo, but particularly euery Saint in Chriſt Ieſus, without omiſſion of any one; that being waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus, and ſanctified by his Spirit, do leade an holy and godly life amongſt you. For ſuch here he calleth Saints in Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; that he would haue euery one of theſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſaluted, appeareth by his vſing of the ſingular number.</p>
                  <pb n="944" facs="tcp:599:556"/>
                  <p>Here then firſt I obſerue a good ground of that Chriſtian cuſtome commonly vſed in writing of letters vnto friends that are abſent; which is, to ſend commendations, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ſalutations and health-wiſhes to ſuch of their friends as are ioyned vnto them in any neare bond of duty, or of loue. Which as it is a good teſtimony of their kinde and louing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards their friends, ſo is it a good meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and to increaſe friendſhip, and is (in effect) a prayer for their health and welfare. And for theſe cauſes it is that this cuſtome of long time hath bene, and is ſtill amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans continued. Which may teach vs alwayes, by all meanes, to reteine and maintaine our loue and friendſhip with the Saints in Chriſt Ieſus: and therefore, when we conuerſe with them, in all louing ſort to vſe them; and when we are abſent from them, in our letters to ſalute them, euen euery of them, as here our Apoſtle doth. As therefore the Apoſtle before exhorteth, ſo do I, whatſoeuer things pertaine to loue, euen to the preſeruing or increaſing of your loue with the Saints in Chriſt Ieſus, thoſe thinke on, and do.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which here I note is, that the Apoſtle ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth the Saints in Chriſt Ieſus. Whence I obſerue that the name and title of Saints is fitly and truly giuen vnto men vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3.</note> 
                     <hi>All my delight,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid, is vpon the Saints that are on the earth, and vpon ſuch as excell in vertue.</hi> And the Apoſtle in all his Epiſtles ſtill writeth vnto the Saints and faithfull brethren, as ye may ſee in the beginning of all his Epiſtles. But who on earth are fitly and truly called Saints? Euen they that being purified by faith, and ſanctified by the Spirit, and waſhed in the bloud of the Lambe, deny vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and liue ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world. For they that are ſuch, are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; they haue put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and he is made of God vnto them wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption. Yea but are not all the ſonnes of men ſo long as they dwell in theſe houſes of clay, vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vnholy? How then can any in this life be fitly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Saints?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 15.</note> True it is that <hi>He layeth folly vpon his Angels,</hi> and that <hi>the heauens are not cleane in his ſight,</hi> and that truly and
<pb n="945" facs="tcp:599:556"/> properly the Lord onely is holy, and that of all the ſonnes of men it is moſt truly ſaid, that there is none that doth good, and ſinneth not, no not one. Yet in Chriſt Ieſus all the ſeede which is according vnto promiſe, is counted holy: holy, for that he is made of God vnto them ſanctification and holines; holy, for that they are waſhed from their ſinnes by the bloud of the Lambe, and ſanctified by the Spirit of grace; holy for that what is wanting in their obedience and holineſſe, is hid and couered in the perfect obedience and holineſſe of Chriſt Ieſus; and holy for that ſanctified deſire which is in them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter holineſſe. And therefore our Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye are waſhed, ye are ſanctified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</note> 
                     <hi>ye are iuſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the Spirit of our God:</hi> Ye are ſanctified, that is, ye are made Saints, and holy. So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, in themſelues, all the ſonnes of men be vnrighteous and vnholy, yet euen in this life all the Iſrael of God in Chriſt Ieſus, are fitly and truly called Saints in ſuch ſort as hath bene ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Vaine then and fooliſh is their conceit that imagine that there are no Saints but ſuch as haue departed this mortalitie in the feare and faith of Chriſt Ieſus. They indeede are well called Saints, and holy is the remembrance of them, neither need they the ſhrines of a ſinfull deceiuer to be called Saints. But not vnto them alone, but vnto you alſo (beloued) is this title due, to be called Saints, if ye be in Chriſt Ieſus, and walke worthy of that calling whereunto he hath called you. Walke therefore worthy of that calling whereunto ye are called. Mortifie the deedes of the fleſh, and walke not after the fleſh but after the Spirit. Be ye filled with the fruites of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and be ye holy in all maner of conuerſation, as he which hath called you is holy. The greater impoſſibilitie that there is in it to be perfectly holy, ſtriue ye the more earneſtly after it; and howſoeuer ye come ſhort, yet with all eagerneſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour ſtill your ſelues vnto that which is before, and follow hard toward the marke for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus. This is the practiſe, and this is the ſtudy of them that are ſanctified by the Spirit of God, and theſe things if ye thinke on, and do, ye are Saints in Chriſt Ieſus.
<pb n="946" facs="tcp:599:557"/> Otherwiſe ye are no Saints, neither do ye belong vnto the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace. And this know for a ſuretie, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are not Saints on earth, ſhall neuer be Saints in heauen. As therefore ye deſire in your ſoules there to be, ſo ſtudie and giue all diligence here to be. Be ye in Chriſt Ieſus, and then ye are Saints; be ye Saints, and then ye are in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

                     <hi>The brethren:</hi> Hauing remembred his owne ſalutations, now he addeth alſo the ſalutations of others vnto the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians.</hi> And firſt he remembreth the greetings and ſalutations of the brethren vnto the <hi>Philippians.

                  <p>Whence I obſerue, that in letters ſent vnto men abſent, theſe formes of ſpeeches haue not bene vnuſuall or miſliked, to ſay, The brethren ſalute thee, or, Salute the brethren. <hi>All the brethren</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>greete you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4.15.</note> And againe, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the brethren, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more is it to be wondred at, that ſuch formes of ſpeech ſhould now be cenſured, and they that vſe them, noted and traduced for ſuch and ſuch men. Can any man follow a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter patterne then the example of the Apoſtle? Or can any man haue a better warrant then the warrant of the Apoſtle? It may very well be thought, that if <hi>Paul</hi> were now liuing and ſhould now vſe ſuch formes of ſalutations as theſe in the end of his Letters and Epiſtles, he ſhould ſo be cenſured and traduced as now thoſe are that therein follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing which hence I obſerue, is, that as all Chriſtians generally, ſo all Miniſters of the Goſpell in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſhould write, and ſpeake vnto, and account one of an other as brethren. For, as this is true in generall, that we haue all one God for our Father, that we are all begotten by the immortall ſeede of one God, in one wombe of the Church; that we are all baptized into one bodie, and haue bene all made to drinke into one ſpirit, that we are all adopted vnto the ſame inheritance by the ſame Spirit, through Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore are all brethren in Chriſt Ieſus; ſo is it alſo true
<pb n="947" facs="tcp:599:557"/> in all the Miniſters of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, that we all build the ſame houſe, we all preach the ſame Goſpell, we are all called to the diſpenſation of the ſame myſteries, we all ſeeke the glorie of the ſame kingdome, and we are all ſhepheards and biſhops vnder the chiefe Shepheard and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of our ſoules Chriſt Ieſus. Howſoeuer therefore in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree we go one before another, yet ſhould we vſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate one another as brethren.</p>
                  <p>A good note, as for all Chriſtians in generall, ſo for ſuch in the Miniſterie as in gifts, or degree, are before others of their calling. A better example then this of the Apoſtle they cannot follow, to be ſo affectioned towards their inferiors, as it appeareth our Apoſtle was, and in all kindneſſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate as brethren them that labour with them in the Goſpel, as it appeareth our Apoſtle did. It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> Here he remembreth the ſalutations of all the reſt of the Saints that were at <hi>Rome,</hi> vnto them. <hi>All the Saints ſalute you,</hi> to wit, all the reſt of the Saints, that labour not in the Goſpel, <hi>and moſt of all they which are of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars houſhold,</hi> he vnderſtandeth ſome of <hi>Neroes</hi> Court which did embrace the truth. Which ſalutation the Apoſtle, no doubt, addeth for the ioy and comfort of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that when they ſhould heare, that not only all the Saints at <hi>Rome</hi> ſaluted them, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſome of the Emperours Court which had embraced the truth ſaluted them, yea and were as forward as the beſt in ſaluting them. Whence I obſerue, that the Lord in mercie ſometimes in the Courts of wicked Princes, raiſeth vp faithfull children vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and cauſeth his truth to be loued, and embraced, and profeſſed euen of their Courtiers. What a cruell tyrant, and wicked perſecutor of Chriſtians <hi>Nero</hi> was, the Eccleſiaſticall ſtories mention. He was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of all thoſe wicked perſecutions vnder thoſe ten cruell tyrants in the Primitiue Church, and grew to ſuch a thirſting after bloud, that not onely <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and many other Chriſtians, but his greateſt familiars, his deareſt friends, his neareſt kinred, his brethren, his mother, his wife were ſlaine by his moſt cruell tyranny. Yet euen in this cruell tyrants Court, the Lord had ſome that feared him, and fauoured the
<pb n="948" facs="tcp:599:558"/> truth. Such a one was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his Court, <hi>Ionathan</hi> in <hi>Saules</hi> Court, <hi>Obadiah</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court, and <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> in <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> Court. And ſuch is his mercie, that he will, ſuch is his power, that he can, and ſuch his goodneſſe that he doth cauſe light to ſhine out of darkeneſſe, and beget children in the faith, where the truth is moſt oppugned.</p>
                  <p>Which may teach vs many good leſſons. As firſt not to deſpaire, but that where the truth is moſt oppugned, there the Lord hath ſome that feare him, and worſhip him in truth. No place more vnlike to haue friends vnto the truth, then <hi>Nero</hi> his Court, and yet there were ſuch. And therefore we may hope that euen there where Antichriſt vſurpeth his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, the Lord hath his children which bow not the knee to <hi>Baall.</hi> Onely we are to acknowledge the glorious mercie and power of the Lord therein, that ſo wonderfully dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for his children, and prouideth for his owne glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may ſerue to condemne vs of great back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſſe in a Chriſtian reſolution of a religious profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In <hi>Nero</hi> his Court was great danger of preſent death and cruell torture vnto ſo many as ſhould embrace and profeſſe the truth of Chriſt Ieſus. There the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> in priſon, and many continually butchered and killed for a good profeſſion: yet there were ſuch as embraced the truth in their hearts, and profeſſed it with their mouthes. And how ſhall not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our irreſolute reſolution of a religious profeſſion? We are in no perill of death, or of bonds, or impriſonment for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a bold profeſſion of Chriſtian religion. Nay it is our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with our moſt gracious Prince conſtantly to maintaine the truth againſt errour and ſuperſtition. And yet ſo cold are we a great many of vs in religion, as that a man cannot tell what we are, Papiſts or Proteſtants; and ſo frozen, as that a man would take a many of vs rather to be enemies then friends vnto religion. Either we are afraid and dare not make that profeſſion which we ſhould, for feare of a day; or elſe to ſerue the time, we make ſhew of one, and are indeed another, and ſo cannot make a good profeſſion. Howſoeuer it be, ſo it is that many of vs are of no reſolution in religion. Well, it ſhould not be ſo, but though we were in <hi>Nero</hi> his Court, we
<pb n="949" facs="tcp:599:558"/> ſhould make a good profeſſion; and though there were no way for vs but to be caſt into the hote fierie fornace, yet ſhould we with the three children proteſt,<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The grace, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words the Apoſtle ſhutteth vp all, and as it were ſealeth his letter with that vſuall prayer which he vſeth both in the beginning and in the end almoſt of all his Epiſtles. Where ye ſee the thing which he wiſheth them is grace, which when he calleth <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> he therein noteth whence it is deriued vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. By grace he vnderſtandeth both the firſt and ſecond grace, both the free fauour of God which is the fountaine of all good things, and the good things themſelues which flow from that fountaine. Now this is called the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe it is deriued from God by him vnto his children, by him I ſay, euen by our Lord vnto whom al power is giuen both in heauen and in earth; by our Lord Ieſus that ſaueth his people from their ſinnes; by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt annointed a King to defend vs, a Prophet to teach vs, a Prieſt to offer vp a ſacrifice for our ſinnes. So that the Apoſtles praier here for the <hi>Philippians</hi> is, ye ſee, that whatſoeuer grace our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for his Church, may be with them all, to fill them with all goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Would ye then know how to pray for all good either vnto Gods Church, or any of Gods children? Learne of our Apoſtle, and pray that the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt may be with them. For herein ye pray both for all ſpirituall grace in heauenly things vnto them, and for all temporall bleſſings which in his gracious fauour he vouchſafeth for the good of his Church and children, being all couched in this, <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, would ye know by whom all grace is deriued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, be it ſpirituall grace, or temporall bleſſing, the grace of God whereby he loueth vs, or the grace of God whereby his loue is made knowne vnto vs? Learne of our Apoſtle, it is by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; for therefore is it called the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe it is deriued by him vnto vs,
<pb n="950" facs="tcp:599:559"/> he hauing reconciled vs vnto God, and we with him hauing all things giuen vnto vs. Knowing then the exceeding great riches that we haue in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, let vs alwaies in all things glorifie the name of Chriſt Ieſus; and as by him we haue all things, ſo let vs do all things to his glorie.</p>
